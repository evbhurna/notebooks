At the bus stop.
Boys
School day, school day, teacher's golden ru...
Kyle Broflovski
Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
Ike Broflovski
Zeeponanner.
Kyle
Ike, you can't come to school with me. [Ike Chortles.]
Eric Cartman
Yeah, go home you little dildo!
Kyle
Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
Stan Marsh
What's a dildo?
Kyle
Well, I don't know...[He faces Cartman and points at him.] and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
Cartman
I know what it means!
Kyle
Well, what?
Cartman
I'm not telling you.
Stan
What's a dildo, Kenny?
Kenny McCormick
(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina.) [The others laugh.]
Cartman
He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right! [Kyle swings Ike by his feet, knocking Cartman down.] Ow! [Ike Laughs.]
Stan
Dude, that kicks ass!
Kyle
Yeah, check this one out. Ready Ike? Kick the baby!
Ike
Don't kick the baby.
Kyle
Kick the baby.
He kicks Ike like a football, who lands, knocking down four mailboxes. Cartman yawns.
Stan
Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
Cartman
That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
Kyle
Really? What about?
Cartman
Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...
The dream sequence begins.
Cartman
...in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.
Through his window, one can see a spaceship land and its light stream in.
Cartman
Then slowly my bedroom door began to open... [A Visitor peeks inside.]
Cartman
...and then the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.
Cartman
Weeaak!
Cartman
Then I was lying on a table...
Cartman is laying face down, Visitors lower his pajamas.
Cartman
...and these scary aliens wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes.
Stan
Dude! Visitors!
Kyle
Totally!
Cartman
What?
Stan
That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were Visitors!
Cartman
No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
Stan
Visitors are real.
Kyle
Yeah, they abduct people and they mutilate cows.
Cartman
Oh, shut up guys! You're just trying to make me scared. And it's not working.
Chef
[Drives up and gets out of the car.] Hello there, children.
Boys
[in unison] Hey, Chef.
Stan
What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
Chef
Well, today it's Salisbury steak with buttered noodles and a choice of green bean casserole or vegetable medley.
Cartman
Kick ass.
Chef
Say, did any of you children see the alien space ship last night?
Cartman
[Surprised.] Huh?
Kyle
Yeah, fat boy saw it!
Cartman
Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
Chef
Oh, was it the ones with the big long heads and the black eyes?
Cartman
Oh!
Stan
They took him on their ship.
Chef
Oh! [Quietly.] Did they give you an anal probe?
Cartman
Oh!
Kyle
What's an anal probe?
Chef
That's when they put this big metal hoop-a-joop up yo' butt.
Kyle
Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
Cartman
No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
Stan
Dude, they did, huh? Aliens stuck stuff up your ass!
Cartman
No!
Ike
Eneh probe.
Cartman
Shut up, dildo!
Chef
Well, I gotta get to the cafeteria. You children watch that fat boy now. He could be under alien control.
Chef walks back to his car, there is a picture of a Visitor on his shirt with the word "Believe" written under it. Cartman goes catatonic as Chef drives off.
Cartman
Oh!
Kyle
We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
Cartman
God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
They start to file onto the bus.
Kyle
Why you walkin' so funny Cartman?
Cartman
Shut up!
Ike
[Waddles by.] Oh foonuh bebe.
Kyle
No, Ike, go home.
Ike
Eeeeee!
Kyle
This is it. This one's for the game.
Ike
Purplor.
Kyle
Kick the baby!
He kicks Ike, who flies through the first window of the school bus and crashes out the window on the other side.
On the bus.
Stan
Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
Ms. Veronica Crabtree
SIT DOWN! WE"RE RUNNING LATE!
The bus pulls away, leaving Ike behind at the bus stop. Kyle is kneeling on the seat looking out the back window at him.
Kyle
Damn it, he's still there.
Stan
Oh, don't worry about him.
Kyle
No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
Ms. Crabtree
SIT DOWN BACK THERE! AAAAAAH!!
Stan
Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
Ms. Crabtree
WHAT DID YOU SAY!?
Stan
I said I have a bad itch.
Ms. Crabtree
[calmly] Oh.
Kyle
[Gasps.] Oh, my God!
Two Visitors are holding Ike between them
Stan
[Turning to see.] Visitors!
Kenny
(Oh nooo!)
Kyle
Ike! [Kyle runs to the front of the bus.] STOP THE BUUUUUS! Ms. Crabtree, you have to stop this bus!
Ms. Crabtree
DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL!?
Kyle
No.
Ms. Crabtree
Then sit down!
Kyle
But I...
Ms. Crabtree
Arrgghhh!
Kyle
Arrghh!
Kyle, Ms. Crabtree
Arrrggghhh!
Kyle runs back to his seat. Ms. Crabtree has the last word.
Stan
Cartman, are those the same Visitors you saw?
Cartman
Shut up you guys, it's not working.
Kyle
We have to do something!
Stan
Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
Ms. Crabtree
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
Stan
Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh. Well, yes, they certainly do.
she makes a hard right, flinging kids onto the left side of the bus.
Kyle
What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Stan farts.] You farted. [They laugh.]
Cartman
Heh, somebody's baking brownies.
Behind the bus, a space craft rises into the sky, then zooms away.
Farmer's grazing fields with a mutilated cow.
Farmer Carl Denkins
That's the third cow this month. At this rate all my cattle are gonna die before the winter's through.
The cows moo questioningly.
Officer Barbrady
This is nothing out of the unusual. Cows turn themselves inside out all the time.
The cows shake their heads.
Farmer Carl
People been saying they've been seeing UFO's around.
Officer Barbrady
UFO's? [Laughs.]
Farmer Carl
Yeah, and black army CIA helicopters and trucks.
Officer Barbrady
That is the silliest thing I've ever heard.
Helicopters fly by above him.
Farmer Carl
What was that?
Officer Barbrady
That, that was a pigeon.
Farmer Carl
What am I supposed to do, Barbrady? Just stand here and watch my cattle get mutilated one by one?
The cows notice something and raise their heads. One Visitor waves a piece of hay and whistles. The cows start running away from them.
Farmer Carl
Hey! My cattle!
The "Cattle Ranch" sign falls down.
Farmer Carl
You see? There is somethin' funny goin' on!
Officer Barbrady
There's nothing funny going on. I'll get those cows back.
Mr. Garrison's class.
Mr. Herbert Garrison
And now children, our friend, Mr. Hat, is going to tell us about Christopher Columbus.
Mr. Hat
That's right, Mr. Garrison. Christopher Columbus discovered America and was the Indians' best friend. He helped the Indians win their war against Fredrick Douglass and a freed the Hebrews from Napoleon and discovered France. And then in 1492 Columbus started a restaurant...[He is drowned out by Kyle's voice.]
Kyle
[Whispering.] Oh, man. I can't just sit here, I have to help my stupid brother, or I'll come home without him and my dad will start yelling, "Where's your brother, Kyle?" "You weren't looking out for your little brother, Kyle?"
Stan
[Whispering.] Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
Kyle
[His voice is rising to an audible level.] "You know he can't think on his own, Kyle!" "Brush and floss, Kyle!" "Where has that finger been, Kyle?"
Stan
Dude!
Mr. Garrison
Is there a problem, boys?
Kyle
Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
Kyle
No, my little brother's been abducted by aliens. [Silence.] It's true! Ask Cartman, they gave him an anal probe.
Cartman
[Embarrassed.] Heh, heh, that's a, that's, that's a little joke. Heh, heh.
Kyle
[Kyle walks up to Mr. Garrison's desk.] Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
Mr. Garrison
I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
Kyle
I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
Mr. Garrison
Oh I think you should ask Mr. Hat.
Kyle
Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
Mr. Hat
Well, Kyle, no!! You hear me?! You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Mr. Garrison
Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
Kyle
Damn it!
Cartman
Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.
Cartman farts fire. Poor Pip is stunned.
Cartman
Ow! My ass!
The class gasps.
Stan
Dude!
Kyle
Damn, Cartman!
Cartman
[Cartman farts fire again.] Uh... Ow! My ass!
Kyle
Dude, he's farting fire!
Stan
It's the alien anal probe. It's shooting fire from Cartman's rectum!
Cartman
No, that was just a dream.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
Cartman
No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine.
Cartman farts fire again, setting Pip aflame. Pip runs around the room on fire.
Train station. Cows flock in from all around and stand in line, waiting to board the train out of town.
Train Conductor
Hey, you cows can't get on this train! This is a people train. You cows have no business on a people train, all right? 'Cause you're cows.
The cows are all staring at the conductor.
Train Conductor
No, no, no. Don't try any of that cow hypnosis on me, all right? 'Cause it's not gonna work.
Officer Barbrady
[Drives by with his lights flashing.] Hold it right there, cows!
Cows split up and run off mooing.
Officer Barbrady
Come back here! Now then! [He pursues them.]
Cafeteria
Kid
So then I had bad, bad gas.
Jason
Ya, seriously, killer.
Cartman
[Cartman farts fire.] Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.
Stan
How can you eat when you're farting fire?
Cartman
Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
Kyle
Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
Stan
[Gasps.] Where?
He finds himself looking right at her. An epiphany plays while hearts dance around Stan's head. Stan smiles, and it soon goes from ear to ear
Cartman
[Singing.] Stan wants to ki-iss Wendy Testabur-ger.
Stan
Shut up, fat ass! I don't even like her!
Cartman
I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
Stan
I do not!
Wendy Testaburger
Hi, guys.
Kyle, Cartman
Hi, Wendy.
Wendy
Here, Stan. This is for you. [Wendy hands Stan a note.]
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww! [She leaves.]
Kyle, Cartman
[Their eyes follow her out.] Bye, Wendy.
Kyle
Dude, what does the note say?
Stan
[He glances at it.] Holy crap! It says she wants to meet me at Stark's Pond after school.
A look of wonder comes over his face.
Kyle
Whoa! Maybe you can kiss her.
Cartman
Or slip her the tongue.
Kenny
(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
Stan
[That gets his attention.] What? How do you know she has a cat?
Silence, Kenny waits to see if the other guys got the message, then laughs. The rest follow, realizing what Kenny meant.
Kyle
Come on you guys, we need to figure out how to get out of school so we can get my little brother back.
The cafeteria kitchen. Chef stands behind the counter, ready to serve food. The boys enter.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Boys
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How are you doing?
Kyle
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
Chef
Oh, children, children, that's a problem we've all had to face at some time or another. Here, let me sing you a little song. It might clear things up.
I'm gonna make love to you woman
Gonna lay you down by the fire
And caress your womanly body
Make you moooooan and perspire
Gonna--

Stan
Uh, Chef?
Chef
--get those juices flowin'--

Stan
Chef.
Chef
--we're makin' love gravy--

Stan
Chef!
Chef
--love gravy, lovelovelovelovelove gravih!

Stan
[shouts loud enough for Chef to hear] CHEF!!!
Chef
Love luh--

Huh?
Silence. Kenny nods towards Kyle.
Chef
Do you feel better?
Kyle
No!
Chef
Oh, come on children, what could be so bad? It's Salisbury steak day.
Stan
Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
Chef
What?!
Chef tosses a food tray aside and runs to the other side of the counter.
Chef
What the hell do you think you're doing in school eatin' Salisbury steak?! Go find him, damn it!
Kyle
Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
Cartman
You are making it up.
Cartman farts more fire, the anal probe pops out, moves around and puts its metal arms on its hip, looking annoyed at Cartman's determination that it didn't happen.
Stan
Whoa!
The probe goes back into Cartman's ass.
Cartman
What?
Kyle
That was cool!
Chef
It's uh some kind of symbiotic, metamorphosis device.
Cartman turns about so Chef can check out the probe.
Chef
This could mean the Visitors want to communicate with us.
Cartman
[Turning to face Chef, testily.] Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?
Chef
It's no joke, children, this is big!
Kyle
Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
Chef
Uuh, hold on now, hold on now. [To himself.] Uhyouyouyou you gotta help the children.
Cartman
Oh, you guys sure are going a long ways to try and scare me. I want my Salisbury steak!
Chef
[Pulling on the fire alarm] Fire drill! Fire drill! Everybody out! [To the boys.] Okay children, this is your chance!
Stan
Killer! Thanks, Chef.
Chef
Mahahahahan oh man, first contact with the alien Visitors. I've got to get myself ready.
The boys' neighborhood.
Boys
[Singing.]
We got out of school,
No more school today,
We got out of school...

Cartman, interrupting the song with a fiery fart.
Cartman
Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
Stan
Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
Cartman
I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
Kyle
Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
Cartman
Uh—Would you stop going on about your little brother? I know it was just a dream, I know I didn't have an anal probe, and I know that I'm not under alien control!
a radio wave strikes Cartman and he gets big blushy cheeks and starts to sing.
Cartman
I love to singa,
About the moona and June-a and the springa,
I love to singa,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...

A second radio wave reverts him to normal and all is quiet. Dogs bark in the background.
Stan
What the hell was that?
Kyle
He is under alien control. That thing in his butt is linked up to the Visitors!
Cartman
Ah, son of a bitch!
Cartman
You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
Kyle yells into Cartman's ear. His voice echoes.
Kyle
Hey!
Cartman
Uh...
Kyle
If you Visitors can hear me-
The voice echoes in Cartman's head.
Cartman
Hey...
Kyle
-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
Cartman
Ow! [Faces Kyle.] That hurts, you buttlicker!
Stan notices a spaceship hovering overhead.
Stan
Kyle, look! It's them.
Kyle
Give me back my brother!
Kyle throws a rock at the spaceship. It fires back with a flash of light, hitting Kenny and knocking him into the road.
Stan
Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards! Come back here! Coomme baack!
The spaceship leaves.
Kyle
Damn it, we were so close!
Stan
Hey look, [Kenny gets up.] I think Kenny's okay.
Kenny
(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!)
The fleeing cows run over Kenny.
Stan
Owww.
Kenny
[He gets up again.] (Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!)
Officer Barbrady mows him down with his police cruiser. Kenny ends up along the curb, lifeless. The boys approach.
Stan
Wow, poor Kenny.
Kyle
Now do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman
No!
Kyle
Cartman, they killed Kenny!
Cartman
He's not dead.
Stan
Dude, Kenny is dead!
Stan picks up a stick and hits Kenny's bloody body.
Stan
See?
Cartman
Shut up, you guys.
Kyle
He's dead, Cartman!
Kyle pulls Kenny's head off his body.
Cartman
God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe! [He walks off.] Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
Kyle
Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
Cartman
[Off screen.] Dildo!
Kyle
You're all I have left, Stan.
Stan
Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
Kyle
You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude!
Rats feast upon Kenny's body.
Stan
Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. [He hurries away.]
Rats drag Kenny's head off.
Kyle
Rats.
Cartman's house.
Liane Cartman
Hello, Eric.
Cartman
Hi, Mom.
Liane
How are you doing?
Cartman
Well, I'm pissed off!
Liane
Here, I made you powdered donut pancake surprise.
Cartman
I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
Liane
You're not fat, you're big boned.
Cartman
That's what I said.
Liane
You can have an eensy weensy bit, can't you?
Cartman
No!
Liane
Just a weensy eensy woo woo?
Cartman
No, leave me alone mom! [He walks past her.]
Liane
How about a nice chocolate chicken pot pie, then?
Cartman
[He stops in his tracks.] What? Well, that does sound pretty good.
He returns to sit on the sofa while his mom goes off to get the pie.
Cartman
Uh, Mom?
Liane
Yes, hon?
Cartman
If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
Liane
Sure, hon. You want some Cheesy Poofs, too?
Cartman is in disbelief she even asked.
Cartman
Yeah, I want Cheesy Poofs.
Stark's Pond. Kyle decided to join Stan.
Kyle
Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the Visitors now.
Stan
But her note said she'd be here.
Wendy appears out of nowhere.
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww!
Kyle
You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
Wendy
But why, Stan?
Stan tries to hold it in.
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww!
Kyle
Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
Wendy
[Turns to Kyle.] Huh?
Kyle
Just make sweet love down by the fire.
Wendy
What happened to your little brother?
Cartman's house. Cartman is on the sofa watching TV.
News Reporter
As the reports of UFO sightings increase, more mysterious crop circle patterns are appearing in fields all around South Park. These crop circles, when viewed from above, form strange patterns.
A plane circles around a field with odd patterns on it, and a cameraman pans out to reveal the outline of Cartman.
Cartman
Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
News Reporter
Could it be that aliens are trying to make contact with us, here on Earth?
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Noticing Mr. Kitty eyeing his pot pie.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!
Kitty hisses.
Cartman
Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
Liane peeks in suggestively.
Liane
Well, then. I know a certain kitty-kitty who's sleeping with Mommy tonight.
Cartman
[Confused.] What?
Stark's Pond. Kyle is explaining what happened to his little brother.
Kyle
...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
Wendy
Well, why don't you go get the fat kid?
Kyle
Why?
Wendy
Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the Visitors are using him as part of their plan. You should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
Kyle
Hey. You're right, Wendy. Come on, Stan, we have to go get Cartman. [He moves out.]
Wendy
Come on, Stan. [She walks past him, following Kyle.]
Stan
Bleech!
Wendy
Eww! [She walks away.]
Stan
Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love?
A bird flies into his puke and starts waddling around in it.
Cartman's House, a short time later.
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, you can't have any!
Mr. Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie! Bad Kitty--!
Cartman farts fire, setting the cat ablaze.
Cartman
Eh, 'scuse me, Kitty.
Liane enters the room with Kyle, Stan, and Wendy.
Liane
Eric, look who's here.
Cartman
Dude, weak mom.
Kyle
Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
Cartman
I can't, my mom said...
Liane
That's okay, Eric, I think you need to go spend time with your little friends.
Cartman
[Quietly.] But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
Liane
[Stern.] Don't be difficult, Eric! Now, you go out and play in the fun snow.
Cartman
God damn it!
Mr. Kitty then runs by in flames.
Forest at night. Cartman's right foot is tied to a tree.
Cartman
You guys, I have to get home.
Stan
Don't be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
Cartman tugs his foot testing the rope.
Cartman
Oh, man, this sucks.
Kyle
How come the Visitors aren't coming for him?
Stan
I think we have to signal them somehow.
Cartman
[Cartman farts fire.] Ow!
Wendy
Hey, he's like Rudolph.
Kyle
Yeah! All you have to do is fart some more, Cartman, and the Visitors are sure to come!
Cartman
Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
Kyle
Sure you do!
Stan
Come on Cartman, fart!
Cartman
I don't wanna.
Stan
[To Kyle and Wendy.] He can't hold it in forever.
Kyle
Fart, damn you!
Cartman
Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!
Farts. An anal probe comes out of his butt and expands.
Cartman
I'm sick of it! It's completely immature.
Stan
Hey, it's happening again.
The probe is now a large satellite dish.
Kyle
Whoa, look at that.
Stan
Now, do you believe us, Cartman?
Cartman
You guys can't scare me! I know you're making it all up.
Stan
Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
Cartman
Sure, you guys, what-ever.
The dish sends a radio signal out to space.
Chef's yard. He's sitting in a lawn chair with a can of ZOOP in his hand. An Igloo cooler is next to him.
Chef
Oh, boy. The aliens are going to make first contact. Hey, down here, we are ready for your wisdom! [He looks at his watch.] And you've only got 20 minutes before Sanford and Son is on.
Forest.
Cartman
You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!
Three small ships descend, followed by a mother-ship.
Cartman
Oh, God damn it!
Mr. Garrison
[Driving by, he stops.] What the? I tell you, there's some crazy stuff going on in this town.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Stan
Come down here, you stinking aliens! [Three Visitors appear.]
Kyle
Uh, uh...
Stan
Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
Kyle
Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing.
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
Stan
That was beautiful, dude.
Kyle
Did it work?
Stan
No, they're leaving.
Kyle
Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Kyle
You know what you fuckers like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
Stan
Hey Wendy, what's a fuck? [She shrugs.]
The spaceship door opens.
Ike
Help me doy tair.
Kyle
Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
Ike
Don't hurt me.
A herd of cows runs away from the ship, but a trio of Visitors stops them in their tracks. The cows moo and quiver with fear until the middle Visitor raises its hand and addresses them.
Visitor
Moo... Moo...Moo...Moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)
Cows
Moo?? (Really??)
Kyle
Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
Ike
Don't kick the baby.
Visitor
Moo moo, moo. Moo moo, moo. Moo. (We have experimented with all the beings of Earth, and we have learned that you are the most intelligent and wise.)
Cartman
What the hell are they talking about?
Cow
Moo moo? (Why did you turn some of us inside out?)
Visitor
Moo moo, moo. Moo. (Oh, that was Carl's fault. He's new.)
Visitor Carl
Moo...moo...moo. (Yeah, sorry about that. My bad!)
Kyle
Ike!
Visitor
Moo moo. Moo moo. Moo. (Take this device. It is a gift from us.)
The cows look at each other and moo in agreement.
Kyle
Ike! Do your impersonation of David Caruso's career!
Ike
It's my turn!
Ike dives from the ship into the snow. The satellite goes back into Cartman's butt.
Visitor
Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)
The Visitors disappear. The spaceship pulls Cartman up but the rope keeps him grounded.
Cartman
You guys, get me down from here!
He farts fire, burning the rope. The tractor beam takes him into the ship and the spaceship flies away.
Cartman
Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
Stan
Phew, I'm sure glad that's over with.
Kyle
Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
Ike
Oh, he fly out the sky.
Chef's yard.
Chef
Wait, where are you going, alien Visitors? Come back!
A blonde arrives with a brunette.
Blonde
Well, Chef, where's this amazing thing you were going to show us.
Chef
Well, it's in the bedroom, ladies. Come on in.
Forest.
Kyle
Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. [They leave.]
Stan
Thanks for your help, Wendy.
Wendy
Whatever, dude.
Stan
Hey, I didn't throw up.
Wendy
Cool!
She's happy now. They both look at each other like they're going to kiss, and that music plays again. Wendy puckers up. Stan gets queasy.
Stan
Bleech!
He barfs right on her face.
Wendy
Eww!
Stan
Sorry.
Wendy
Hey, look. A French fry.
Stan
Cool.
Wendy
And what is that?
Stan
I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof.
Chef's song starts up and the camera pulls away.
Wendy
Hey, what's that?
Stan
That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
Wendy
Oh hey, what about that?
Stan
I don't know what the hell that is...
Bus Stop.
Stan
Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
Kyle
Yeah, we're running out of friends.
Stan
I wonder what that thing was that the Visitors gave the cows.
Cows out on a pasture.
Cows
Mooo.
Officer Barbrady
Ha ha cows! I've got you cornered. Let's see you get away now.
One of the cows steps on the plate on the Visitor's device. A beam from the device strikes Officer Barbrady. His glasses fly off, and cheeks become rosy.
Officer Barbrady
I love to sing-a,
About the moon-a and the June-a and the Spring-a,
I love to sing-a,
About a sky of blue-a or a tea for two-a...

The cows begin hopping about gleefully.
Bus Stop. Cartman falls out of the sky, landing on his side next to Kyle and Stan.
Cartman
Puh!
Stan
Oh, hey Cartman.
Kyle
Wow Cartman, the Visitors dropped you off just in time to go to school.
Cartman
Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
Stan
Really, what about?
Cartman
Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there was... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
Stan
That wasn't a dream, Cartman. That really happened.
Cartman
[Sarcastically.] Oh right, [Matter of factly.] why don't I have pinkeye then?
Kyle
Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
Cartman
Ahh, son of a bitch!
	Mr. Garrison's classroom.
Kyle
Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?
Stan
Yeah, it was huge.
Cartman
Ugh, I hate those things.
Kyle
Nobody hates rainbows.
Stan
Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
Cartman
Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: "EHY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!" [Silence.]
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
Cartman
I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
Kyle
Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
Cartman
Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool.
Stan
What were you talking about?
Cartman
Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it.
Kyle
No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
Cartman
Nothing..!
Mr. Garrison
Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? [Silence.] One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize.
Wendy
[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win.
Mr. Hat
Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting.
Mr. Garrison
That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
Wendy
What?
Cartman
What?
Mr. Garrison
Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
Cartman
Kick ass!
Stan
That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart.
Cartman
Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
Mr. Garrison
Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner.
Kyle
Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, you know, this and that.
Wendy
He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
Kyle
What was your paper about Wendy?
Wendy
My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
Cartman
There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
Cartman
Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
Wendy
What?
Mr. Garrison
Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford.
Kyle
Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
Mr. Garrison
And the presentation will be on national television.
Stan, Kyle
Television!
Mr. Garrison
[Thinking to himself.] Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
City Hall. Mayor's Office.
Mayor McDaniels
Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
Ted
Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator.
Johnson
Maybe even a State Senator.
Ted
Mayor, we should decorate the town square.
Johnson
Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town.
Mayor McDaniels
That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?
Ted
Black as the night itself Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
Ted
If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
Johnson
Ohhh.
Ted
Ouch. [Johnson Laughs.] Thank you.
South Park Elementary Cafeteria.
Cartman
You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous.
Wendy
[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too.
Chef
[Stopping by.] Hello there children.
Kyle, Stan
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How are my little crackers today?
Kyle, Stan
Good.
Chef
Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
Stan
Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
Cartman
Hey!
Chef
Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
Kyle
Wow, are you gonna do it?
Chef
Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation.
Stan
Yeah, that'd be cool.
Kenny
(How big's your penis, Chef?)
Chef
Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway.
He giggles, somewhat embarrassed.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom. Garrison is at his desk and Mr. Hat is across from him in a chair.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.
Notices Mr. Hat.
Mr. Garrison
Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
[Now on Mr. Garrison's hand.] Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
Mr. Garrison
Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child.
Mr. Hat
We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge.
Flashback to the National Talents Show Finals.
Lil Mr. Garrison
Knock knock, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
Who's there?
Lil Mr. Garrison
Orange.
Mr. Hat
Orange who?
Lil Mr. Garrison
Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
One person claps.
Mr. Hat
Thank you.
Judges show scores of 8.9, 9, 7.8 and 9.2.
Lil Mr. Garrison
Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win.
Show Announcer
And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein.
Lil Kathie Lee
If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
[Mexican puppet] All I can say is, "Wow-wee, look-a where I am."
[Tourist puppet] Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!

Crowd goes wild. Judges show all 10's. Little Garrison is shocked.
In the present.
Mr. Garrison
It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?
Mr. Hat
But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better.
Mr. Garrison
How?
Mr. Hat whispers to Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
Mr. Garrison's Classroom, later in the day. The Mayor is now there.
Mayor McDaniels
Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay.
Cartman
That kid is me.
Mayor McDaniels
Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park.
Mr. Garrison
That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
Mr. Garrison
[Whispers.] Mr. Hat!
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
Wendy
Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
Mayor McDaniels
Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!
Silence.
Mayor McDaniels
And who's our little prize winner again?
Cartman
Me! Eric Cartman!
Mayor McDaniels
How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?
Cartman
Yes ma'am. [Sings.]
I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television.

Bus Stop The kids have gotten off the bus and are going home.
Cartman
[Still singing.]
...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television...

Stan
[Turning to face Cartman.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
Cartman
Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
Stan
Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
Cartman
Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
Stan
Dolphins are way smarter than you!
Cartman
If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
Stan
Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!
Cartman
Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
Stan
Tell me what you wrote about!
Cartman
I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
Stan
Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!
Cartman
Screw you, hippie!
Cartman's House. Cartman is sitting on the couch in front of the TV eating Cheesy Poofs.
TV Announcer
We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this.
Beefcake
Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
Cartman
Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
Beefcake
Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!
Cartman
Yes!
Beefcake
With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go to directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'
Cartman
Beefcake!
Beefcake
Beefcake!
Cartman
Beefcake!
Beefcake
Beefcake!
Beefcake, Cartman
[In unison] BEEFCAKE!
TV Announcer
May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver...
Cartman
Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?
Liane
Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow.
Cartman
But mom, I need it for tomorrow.
Liane
But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.
Cartman
[Shrieking.] Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!
Liane
Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then.
Cartman smiles broadly.
Mr. Garrison's Bed. He hears Kathie Lee singing in his head: "If they could see me now, that little crowd of mine, and eating fancy chow..." He wakes up startled.
Mr. Garrison
No, no!
Mr. Hat
[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
Mr. Garrison
No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it.
Mr. Hat's head starts spinning slowly, demonically, his pupils glow red.
Mr. Hat
Kill!
Mr. Garrison
That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
She'll make a fool of you again.
Mr. Garrison
Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy.
Bus Stop, next morning.
Cartman is a bit bigger and showing it off by wearing a Beefcake muscle shirt instead of layers of clothes.
Cartman
Hey dudes.
Kyle
What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
Cartman
Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
Stan
What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
Cartman
I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
Kenny
(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
Kyle
Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's.
The others laugh.
Cartman
Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff.
He chugs the can of Weight Gain.
Stan
What's that stuff?
Cartman
Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up.
Kyle
Bulk up to what, fat-ass?
Stan
Super fat-ass?
Cartman
Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
The bus Arrives and the others go in ahead of him.
Cartman
Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
Town Square. A flag goes up.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!
Cows
[Out in a pasture.] Mooooo?
Outdoor stage. The class has moved there to practice a play.
Mayor McDaniels
Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?
Mr. Garrison
Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.
Stan, Kyle, Butters, and Kevin Stoley go.
Mr. Garrison
Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
Pip, Kenny, Red, and Token go.
Clyde Donovan
Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?
Mr. Garrison
Do you have a feather on your head?
Clyde
Yes.
Mr. Garrison
Then you're an Indian.
Clyde
Oh.
Mr. Garrison
Okay Bebe, this is your line.
Bebe Stevens
[Haltingly.] This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, don't they look adorable?
Bebe
Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers.
Pioneers come on stage and start beating the Indians and tossing them about. Screams are everywhere, and a tee-pee falls in front of Kenny.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh my God!
Mr. Garrison
They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
Bebe
The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands.
Kevin the Indian lands by her, with blood oozing out of a gash on his head. She steps aside. Pioneer Butters punches Indian Pip repeatedly.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford.
Mr. Garrison
Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
Stan
Take that you stupid Indian!
Stan beats Clyde the Indian with the butt of his gun.
Clyde
Dow!
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?
Mr. Garrison
To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
All stop and gasp.
Mr. Garrison
Oh my God, what have I said?
Townsman
He said, "To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"
Boos all around.
Mayor McDaniels
Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play.
Garrison skulks away.
Mr. Garrison's House.
Mr. Hat
[In his deep voice.] It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.
Mr. Garrison
I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.
Mr. Hat laughs.
Town Square Stage.
Kyle
Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
Cartman is much bigger now.
Cartman
Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
Kyle
You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
Cartman
I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
Kyle
Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go "God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"
Cartman
No they don't, you jealous weakling!
Townsman
God damn, that's a big fat ass!
Cartman
Hey!
Wendy
Hi guys.
Cartman
Oh look, another hippie.
Cartman gives her the peace sign.
Cartman
Peace, Wendy.
Stan
Shut up Cartman!
Cartman
Oooh,
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...

Wendy moves by Cartman and then whispers to Stan.
Wendy
I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
Cartman
...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...

Jimbo's Guns. There is a poster welcoming Kathie Lee on the left side of the store entrance.
Jimbo Kern
Can I help you?
Mr. Garrison
Yes... I need a gun.
Jimbo
Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?
Mr. Garrison
Other.
Jimbo
Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!
Hands Mr. Garrison a gun.
Jimbo
That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
Mr. Garrison
[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] I don't know, it's a little small.
Jimbo
Okay, how about this?
Mr. Garrison
[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.
Jimbo
Here's the same gun, with a wood finish.
Mr. Garrison
[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo.] I'll take it!
Mr. Garrison's Classroom, lights out. Wendy enters.
Wendy
Hello?
She sneaks over to file cabinet. Sees her paper first and is disgusted to find Cartman's question in writing: "If dolphins are so smart, why do they live in igloos?" Then she finds Cartman's paper.
Wendy
My essay by Eric Cartman: "When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
Mr. Garrison enters. Wendy hides.
Mr. Garrison
Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!
Wendy
[Hushed.] Oh my God.
Town Square. Mr. Garrison walks down the street with his rifle as if it's normal.
Townsman
Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you.
Townswoman
Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks.
He approaches Officer Barbrady.
Mr. Garrison
Hello Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
Nice Gun.
Mr. Garrison
Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.
Officer Barbrady
Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet.
They look up at it. Two vultures fly around it.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
Officer Barbrady
No problem.
He turns to a fan walking by with a camera.
Officer Barbrady
Heah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage.] Where is she?
Cartman, off stage, looming over his friends now.
Cartman
This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Kyle
I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
Wendy
[Rushing in.] You guys, we have to stop him!
Kyle
Stop who?
Wendy
Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
Cartman
Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
Wendy
He's got a gun!
Cartman
You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
Wendy
It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
Stan
Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
Wendy
[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?
Stan falters and looks down, unable to resist her.
Kyle
Uh oh, we're losing him.
Cartman looks down at Stan.
Mayor McDaniels
Here she comes.
The band starts playing. Kathie Lee comes in riding in bullet proof 'bubble' on the back of a truck.
Mr. Garrison, looking on from the book depository window.
Mr. Garrison
Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
Townswoman
We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh.
Kathie Lee Gifford
I love you, too.
Mr. Garrison
Come on you little bitch. [Takes aim.] You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.
Mayor McDaniels
[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
Crowd cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford.
Chef
Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue.

Mayor McDaniels
What?
Chef
Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy.

Mayor McDaniels
What? Oh God!
Chef
How 'bout you and meee-

Quickly taking the mic from him.
Mayor McDaniels
Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song.
Chef
-get together and make... sweet...

love?
Mayor McDaniels
Thank you Chef!
She grabs the mike and drags him off.
Chef McDaniels
Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!
Wendy
[Wendy and Stan run up.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
Officer Barbrady
What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. [Flashes back.]
Mr. Garrison
Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee.
Officer Barbrady
Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ...
His face gets bigger with every repetition. He snaps to.
Officer Barbrady
Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!
Stan
Wendy, look!
Points to book depository.
Back on stage.
Mayor McDaniels
And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman...
Cartman
Cartman, God damn it.
Mayor McDaniels
...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, [Crowd cheers.] Kathie Lee Gifford!
Kathie Lee is thrust up on stage in her bubble by her security force. Cartman's mom hugs her heart.
Kathie Lee
Thank you. I love you all.
Stan and Wendy reach the Book Depository.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, stop!
Mr. Garrison
Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
Wendy
I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
Mr. Garrison
You can't know.
Wendy
You should have won that talent show.
On the stage.
Kathie Lee
It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?
Cartman
Here it is, my big moment of fame.
Book Depository.
Mr. Garrison
...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
Wendy
I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
Mr. Garrison
It is... too late for me, young Wendy.
Cartman gets on stage, with help from Kyle and Kenny. Mr. Garrison takes aim.
Wendy
You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
Lowering his weapon.
Mr. Garrison
You... you're right.
Wendy
Gooood.
Stan
Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
Mr. Hat
[Snapping into position.] The bitch must die!
The stage. Cartman's weight breaks it.
Kathie Lee
Ooohhhh!
She flies through the air. Mr. Garrison fires at her, thinking she is still on stage. Kenny is hit.
Kenny
(Oh no!)
He flies through the air and is impaled through the head by a flag pole. He slides on down.
Kyle
Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!
Kathie Lee's bubble lands on the truck.
Agent 1
Gun!
Agent 2
Gun!
Kyle
Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play.
The entourage leaves and the crowd groans.
TV Crew Director
I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up.
Cartman
Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
TV Crew Director
Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest.
Cartman
[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest.
Wendy
You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
Into mic.
Wendy
I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.
Townsman 1
Who cares?
Townsman 2
Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone.
Stan
Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
Wendy
Well, not if it's Cartman.
Into mic.
Wendy
Hey, where are you all going!
Aside.
Wendy
They don't even know what Walden is.
Into mic.
Wendy
I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
Stan
Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
Wendy
Ah, what the hell.
Kids walk out.
Mayor McDaniels
Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!
Ted
Uh, Mayor, the mic is on.
In front of flag pole.
Officer Barbrady
[Arresting Mr. Hat.] Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids.
Officer Barbrady
You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
Apparently, he didn't see Kenny get impaled. Kenny's corpse slides down to base of flag pole.
South Park Mental Home, Mr. Garrison's Hospital Room.
Stan
We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
Mr. Hat is in a straitjacket.
Mr. Hat
We can still get her! Let mmm--
Mr. Garrison
I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
Kyle
Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
Mr. Garrison
Really, on what?
Geraldo.
Geraldo Rivera
Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house.
Cartman
When is this going to be on the air?
Geraldo
Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
Cartman
Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
Chef's Bedroom.
Chef
He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
Kathie Lee
Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?
Chef
Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?
	In front of Cartman's house. Jimbo, Ned, and the boys are waiting for Cartman.
Liane
Now you be careful, Eric. The woods can be very dangerous.
Cartman
Okay, Mom.
Kyle
Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
Stan
Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
Jimbo
That's right, Stanley. Animals are much easier to shoot in the morning.
Liane
Here hon, I packed you some cheesy poofs and happy tarts.
Jimbo
Don't worry Mrs. Cartman, we'll take good care of him. I brought my old war buddy Ned to keep things safe.
Ned Gerblansky
Hello, Mrs. Cartman. How are you today?
Liane
Be sure to use lots of bug spray, and if you have to poo-poo, don't wipe with poison ivy.
The other boys laugh.
Cartman
Dude, that's sick mom.
Liane
And I know it can get scary up in those woods, but just remember, mommy's not far away.
They laugh some more.
Cartman
Drive, Drive!
Liane
You give your mommy a kissy.
Cartman
Drive the car damn-it, drive!
In the Humvee.
Kyle
[In a slight falsetto.] Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
Cartman
Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
Stan
Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
Kenny
(Maybe she'll suck my dick.)
Jimbo
Oh, ho, that's disgusting.
Cartman
You piece of crap, I'll kill you!
Cartman starts fighting with Kenny.
Jimbo
That's the spirit boys, let's get that testosterone flowin'.
Cartman
Eeeeenh!
He is about to strike Kenny again.
Jimbo
Now boys, boys, ah-I need to get serious for a minute. I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don't ever walk with your gun unless the safety's on. Second, don't shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.
Stan
Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
Jimbo
You what?!?
Ned
mmmMoh Yeah, that's right, I don't think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.
Kyle
I like chocolate milk.
Jimbo
Well, we'll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober. It sure will be nice to get out of the city for a while, away from civilization.
Jimbo drives the Humvee up a small mountain very close to town.
On the mountain.
Jimbo
Welp, here we are. Okay, each of you young 'uns take a gun, a beer and some smokes.
Cartman
Hey, I didn't get a gun.
Jimbo hands him one.
Cartman
Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
Stan
You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
Ned
Were you stationed in Da Nang?
Stan
Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
Cartman
Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
They point their guns at each other, Jimbo rushes up.
Jimbo
Hey, look out son, that's dangerous. You're gonna spill your beer.
Stan
My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
Kyle
Wow, that'd be cool.
Cartman
My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
Jimbo
Boys, looky there. That there's a Rocky Mountain black bear ...one of the few remaining of its kind. Isn't it beautiful... By God, it's coming right for us!
Shoots it. It is hit and flips off the mound it was on.
Stan
Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
Jimbo
Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.
Kyle
What do you mean?
Jimbo
You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.
Cartman
Democrats piss me off!
Jimbo
They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless they're posing an immediate threat. Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's coming right for us.'
Stan
Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
Ned
Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.
Jimbo
Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge, Ned. It's coming right for us!
Jimbo pulls out a bazooka, mounts it on his shoulder, and fires a rocket. All that's left of the deer is a hind leg, which falls over.
Cartman
Kickass!!
Everyone is in creep position now, except Jimbo.
Jimbo
Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging buck.
Ned
Moohh, rabbit, rabbit, 5 o'clock.
A rabbit hops blissfully into view.
Jimbo
[Drops to the ground.] Let's move, moove!
He hustles off to the right. Ned follows.
Stan
Is this hunting?
Kyle
I guess so.
Cartman
Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
Kyle
What?!
Cartman
Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
On the ridge.
Jimbo
This one's yours Stan.
Stan aims at the bunny, but it just blinks at him. Jimbo coaxes.
Jimbo
[Calmly.]It's coming right for us.
Ned
It's coming right for us.
Stan focuses. The bunny blinks.
Kyle
Shoot it Stan.
Cartman
I got your back, soldier.
Stan lowers his gun.
Stan
I can't.
The bunny hops away.
Jimbo
What the? What's wrong with you?
Stan
I don't wanna shoot the bunny.
Jimbo
What the hell are you talking about, 'you don't wanna shoot the bunny?' You're babbling, you're not making any sense, you're hysterical.
Stan
I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
Jimbo
No nephew of mine is gonna be a tree-hugger.
Cartman
Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
Stan
I can shoot you, fat ass!
Cartman
I can shoot you too!
Stan
I'll kill you!
Cartman
I'll fill you full of lead!
The mountain rumbles.
Kyle
Hey, what's that?
South Park Center for Seismic Activity, Randy is humming: another day and all is quiet. A rumble is heard in the distance, but Randy is dozing off. A stronger rumble rolls through.
Randy checks the seismograph.
Randy Marsh
What the heck is this?
He places a call.
Randy
Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? ...Uh huh ...Uh huh ...Let me check.
He looks out the window at the volcano, which shows a column of steam.
Randy
Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano!
Dramatic music builds, then Randy...sips his coffee.
Night on the mountain.
Cartman
My weenies won't cook.
Ned
Mmm, this wood won't burn, umm.
Jimbo
Well, Ned, looks like we'll have to use the old Indian fire trick.
Ned
Mmm, yepper.
Ned pours gasoline on the fire. The flames run up the stream and set Ned aflame.
Ned
Mmm, aahh, oh.
Jimbo
Hehehaahaa, hey, stop-drop-and roll Ned. Haaahaaaaahaha!!
Ned drops and rolls. He knocks the gas can over, and the flaming gas blows up the Hummer.
Stan, Kyle
Whoa!
Jimbo
Goddamnit Ned, I just got that van. How the hell are we supposed to get home?
Ned
Mmm, oh, it hurts, it hurts, mmm.
Cartman is now cooking his weenies over Ned's burning body.
Cartman
Hey you guys, this works pretty good right meah.
City Hall, The following morning.
Chef
But you see Mr. Mayor, you can't stop serving Salisbury steak in our public schools. What's next, meatloaf?
Mayor McDaniels
We are quite aware of your concerns Chef, but...
The intercom beeps. She answers.
Johnson
Mayor, the geologist is here to see you.
Mayor McDaniels
My geologist? Now? Tell him the infection is fine and I don't need another check-up.
Johnson
No mayor, that's a gynecologist. A geologist studies the earth.
Mayor McDaniels
Don't you think I know that? How dare you insult my intellect, I went to Princeton for God's sake! You get out of my office!
Johnson
I'm not in your office mayor, I'm talking to you through a speaker.
Long pause.
Mayor McDaniels
Just send in the geometrist.
Johnson
Geologist...
Mayor McDaniels
You are fired, buddy!
Johnson
Thank you mayor, it's been great working for you.
Randy enters.
Randy
Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
Mayor McDaniels
What does this mean to the town?
Randy
Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.
He points out relative damage levels on a chart.
Randy
Right now South Park is here.
Mayor McDaniels
My God!
Chef
Mayor, some of the school children, are up camping, on that mountain, right now!
Mayor McDaniels
Ooh, this is big! Johnson, Johnson, are you there? [Beeps out.]
Ted
Uhh, you just fired Johnson, Mayor. I'm his replacement, Ted.
Mayor McDaniels
Ted, we have got a major crisis here. I want you to get on the phone and call Inside Edition, Rescue 911-uh, and Entertainment Tonight-eh. [Thump.] Better get my stylist on the phone too. Don't worry, things are under control.
Back on the Mountain. Jimbo is telling stories.
Jimbo
And then... Ned picked up the grenade and... BOOM, blasted his arm clear off. We spent three hours looking for that damn arm, but it was never to be found. Some say it's still crawling around to this day.
Ned extends his prosthetic arm towards Cartman as if to show that shot-off arm is now at the campsite, climbing on Cartman.
Ned
Mmmowwwh.
Cartman flinches, and the others laugh.
Jimbo
Hah, got ya.
Cartman
Heh, tha-that's not scary.
Kyle
You were scared Cartman! you almost peed your pants!
Cartman
Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
Jimbo
Hey Ned, hand me that gin.
Ned opens up the icebox and tosses a bottle to him.
Jimbo
You boys want to tie one on?
Kyle
No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
Stan
Yeah, Cartman's pee.
Cartman
Hey, you would taste my pee!
Jimbo
What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you have a little alcohol?
Kenny reaches for the gasoline can and chugs away.
Jimbo
Christ, look at that little bastard go!
Kenny hiccups.
Jimbo
Now you see that Stan? Now, now that is a dirty little bastard!
Stan
Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
Cartman
Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
Kyle
Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
Softly, slowly, flashlight ready.
Cartman
Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of [He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.] Scuzzlebutt?
Stan
Whatabutt?
Cartman
Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
Stan
Why?
Cartman
Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
Kyle
Deformed how?
Cartman
Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...
Stan
A hook.
Kyle
A knife.
Cartman
No! A piece of celery.
Stan
Celery?
Cartman
Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but...Patrick Duffy.
Kyle
Patrick Duffy? Damn it Cartman, that's not scary!
Cartman
What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step? [Silence.] So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tashink ...tashink ...tashink.
Stan
Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
Kyle
Yeah, give me that flashlight.
Kyle takes it and turns it off.
The volcano rumbles again.
Kenny
(Hey, what's that?)
Kyle
What is that?
Stan
Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
Cartman
Hey, it might be!
Kyle
Gosh, I hope he doesn't cut me with his celery hand.
The others laugh.
Cartman
Screw you guys! ...Go to Hell!
Jimbo is now playing his guitar.
Jimbo
Hey Ned, why don't you whip out the ol' cancer kazoo? Let's do a little song.
Ned
Abumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
Uumbayah my lord, kumbayah.
[Uncle Jimbo cries]
Mmmoh lord, Kumbayah.
Emsomeone's crying my lord, Kumbayah
Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah...

Cartman
They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of 'em tomorrow!
Ned
...Someone's crying my lord, Kumbayah.
Moh lord, Kumbayah.

Next morning. A rooster crows.
Kyle
Stan, Stan, wake up!
Stan
What, dude?
Kyle
I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
Stan
Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
Kyle
They're out fishing with Kenny.
Stan
With Kenny? But, but this is supposed to be my camping trip. Why do they like Kenny so much? Doesn't he like me anymore?
Kyle
Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
Stan
What?
Kyle farts, and is pleased with himself. Stan does nothing.
In the fishing boat.
Jimbo
What a beautiful morning for fishing. There's one, there's a fish right there!
He throws grenade, killing a fish.
Ned
Mmm, got it.
Kenny throws a grenade, killing four fish.
Jimbo
Great instincts boy.
Stan runs to the side of the lake.
Stan
Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
Jimbo
Who? The fat kid?
Stan
Yeah.
Jimbo
Ah hell, I guess we better go look for him. Ned, we got to cut it short. Fire out the 12-20!
Ned fires the load and a massive amount of fish float to the surface. The boat lands a second later
Jimbo
Well, I think that's about the limit for our fishing permit.
Ned
[Rowing to shore.] Moh man it smells like dead fish here.
Kenny
(A little like a vagina.)
Ned
Em-moh man, that is nasty.
Jimbo
Heh, I don't think I've ever seen a kid as cool as you Kenny. I'm making you... my honorary nephew.
Kenny
(Thanks.)
Stan's head drops.
In front of city hall. The media is now present.
Newscaster
The people of South Park are humble and friendly. But now, a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony.
Crowd
Yeahhh.
They sound more excited than agonized.
Individual in crowd
Hey, I'm on TV! I'm on TV!
Newscaster
Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?
Mayor McDaniels
All we know right now is that some of our children [Sob-sob.] are camping on that mountain and... Oh, I'm sorry, can I start over?
Newscaster
Huh?
Mayor McDaniels
Well you can edit this right? Ready, 3,2,1 [Melodramatically.] All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can't do anything until we get them. Okay people, let's go get those kids.
Chef
Come on everybody. You got to help the children.
On the mountain.
Jimbo
Uh, well, he couldn't have gone far, unless something drug him off.
Ned
There's not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.
Jimbo
Yeah, it's almost like something funny's going on.
The volcano rumbles.
Jimbo
Christ, Ned, what'd you have for breakfast.
Ned
Mm I don't know man. I've got some bad gas.
Jimbo
Wait, there's a ram! It's coming right for us!
Fires at the ram. Kenny takes over.
Jimbo
Nice shootin' Kenny. Here, you need a bigger gun.
Kyle
Look!
Cartman
I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
Ned
Mmm, what is it?
Kyle
Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
Jimbo
Holy crow! We could make a mint killing this thing.
Ned
We'll be on the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
Jimbo
This calls for some HJ-14.
Cartman
[To himself.] Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
Jimbo is now armed with twin shoulder rockets.
Jimbo
Fire in the hoooole!
Cartman
Holy crap!
Cartman jumps out of the way. The rockets hit the mound and debris goes in all directions.
Jimbo
Damn it, I think I missed.
Cartman
What the hell is wrong with you people?!
Jimbo
C'mon, let's move, move!
Cartman sees them coming and backs away.
Cartman
Hey, wait, aah!
Rescue Center.
Mayor McDaniels
Is, is it on? Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!
Randy
Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea.
Mayor McDaniels
Huh, what?
Randy
Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.
Mayor McDaniels
And, that would be good? Right?
Randy
Uh - pretty sure.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!
On the mountain. Jimbo and the others have lost sight of Cartman.
Jimbo
These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way. Ned, prepare some HK-12 and some plasticine. I'll bet that sucker's headed for a higher elevation. The higher up it- BIRD!! [Shoots a bald eagle.] The higher up it goes, the better it can breathe.
Kyle
[Sees Cartman still dressed as Scuzzlebutt] Look, up there.
Cartman
You guys, it's just me.
Jimbo
Are we sure it's Scuzzlebutt?
Stan
Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg?
Jimbo
I can't tell; let's kill it!
Cartman
Eh, gotta get out of this stupid costume.
Jimbo
Kenny, you take the front.
Stan
No!
Stan takes the rifle from Kenny.
Stan
I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
Jimbo
That's the spirit, kiddo. Let's hunt!
Cartman
You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
Townspeople digging trench.
Newscaster
As some people of South Park try desperately to save their mountain town, others look for the missing townspeople. But all must take every precaution necessary.
Rescue Center.
Officer Barbrady
Okay people, listen up. As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.
Mr. Garrison starts the film.
Host
Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a [Film skips] May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It's a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.
Jane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family.
Host
That's right Jane, duck and cover.
She ducks under the blanket herself. The lava rolls over the family, causing no harm. The blanket flies off, revealing a sparkling family.
Host
So what will you [Film skips] -do when you hear a volcano erupting?
Two boys on bikes look alarmed. They leap off their bikes and hit the street, duck, and cover their heads with their arms.
Host
That's right, duck and cover.
The lava rolls over the two, causing no harm.
Host
Looks like you got the idea. Duck and cover. Thank you and goodbye.
Officer Barbrady
OK, any questions?
Chef
That has got to be the most ridiculous load of pig crap I have ever seen!
Officer Barbrady
That's enough out of you!
On the mountain. Cartman moves further up on the slope and turns around.
Stan
I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
Cartman
Hey, seriously you guys!
Kyle
[Hushed.] Kill it, Stan. Kill it. [Normally.] Come on Stan, kill it.
Stan
Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
Jimbo swats Stan behind the head.
Jimbo
You pansy! give me that gun.
Cartman
Hey!
Stan
Cartman?
Cartman
Goddammit, don't shoot me!
Jimbo
What the Sam Hell?
Cartman
I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
Ned
Mmm, so much for the cover of "Guns & Ammo".
Jimbo
Yepper, but I think we've learned some important lessons Ned I think that-
Boom! Lava begins to bubble out and flow.
Kyle
Whoa!
Ned
Mmm, holy crap.
Jimbo
The mountain! It's blown it's top!
A boulder of lava lands in front of Kenny.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kenny steps out from behind the boulder.
Kenny
(Nope, I'm okay.)
Kenny sees his arm on fire.
Kenny
(It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)
The boulder rolls onto Kenny.
Kenny
(Ugh.)
On the side of the mountain.
Townsman 1
Look, the volcano.
Townsman 2
Quick, duck and cover.
They do. The lava sweeps them down the mountainside, burning them to the bone.
At the base of the mountain, Jimbo and the others are moving quickly.
Kyle, Stan, Cartman
Aaaaah!
Jimbo
That lava's coming right for us!!
Behind them a river of lava charges down the mountain.
Looking on from the edge of town.
Chef
Oh no, look.
At the trench. Jimbo and the others have made it out of the mountain, but their way into town has been cut off.
Jimbo
What the hell is this trench doing here?!? We can't get across!
Newscaster
It now looks as if the missing children are trapped in the path of hot, nasty lava.
Mayor McDaniels
God, please deliver those darling kids from... Wait, wait wait wait. 3,2, and 1. God, please deliv-
Cartman
Help!
Scuzzlebutt appears and scratches his belly.
Jimbo
Jimminy Pope, it's the real Scuzzlebutt!
Cartman
What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
Kyle
Oh my God! Look at his leg!
Patrick Duffy
Hi kids, I'm TV's Patrick Duffy.
Jimbo
Quick Ned, shoot it!
Ned aims, but no shot is heard.
Ned
Mmmoh no, out of ammo.
Scuzzlebutt
Grrrr.
Mayor McDaniels
What... is that thing?
Chef
That's Scuzzlebutt.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
Officer Barbrady
This isn't happening. Everyone look away please. Nothing to see here.
Jimbo
Well boys, I'm sorry I got you all killed.
Scuzzlebutt rips a tree from the ground, bites off a limb...
Kyle
Aaaaah!
...and molds the tree into a-
Stan
Whoa, he built a wicker basket.
Jimbo
Hey, he's saving us.
Scuzzlebutt puts the group in the basket and lifts them over the trench.
Scuzzlebutt
Grrr.
Liane
Scuzzlebutt saved the day.
Randy
And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
Mayor McDaniels
Hmmm. Where exactly does the canyon go?
Randy
Uhh...
Denver citizens
Aaaaah.
South Park. The ordeal is over.
Mr. Garrison
South Park is saved.
Cheers go up.
Kyle
Hey look, Kenny's okay.
Kenny appears on a mound nearby.
Kenny
(Hey guys, what's goin' down?)
Newscaster
And now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their jovial victory over nature. I'm getting word that the chef of the school cafeteria wants to sing a song about this thrilling struggle of humanity.
Chef
Mmmm
Baby every time that we kiss,
Hot Lava!
Every time that we make love, hot lava,
Hot Lava!
Lava so hot it makes me sweat,
Lava so warm and red and wet,
Lava!
Brrrrrrrrrrrr.

Newscaster
Mayor, what do you have to say about this wonderful outcome?
Mayor McDaniels
Well, we owe everything to this friendly, yet misunderstood creature. Thank you Scuzzlebutt.
Scuzzlebutt
Friend.
Scuzzlebutt presents flowers to the Mayor.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, how sweet.
Stan shoots scuzzlebutt.
Stan
I did it, I did it, I finally killed something.
He smiles, proud of himself. Unfortunately, this took place during a live report.
Newscaster
Oh my God! What has he done?
Mayor McDaniels
Turn off the cameras!
Stan
Hey, that was easy!
Patrick Duffy
Noooo! Why God? Why?!
Jimbo
Damn it Stan, you shouldn't have done that!
Stan
What?! Why?!
Kyle
Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
Jimbo
Stan, some things you kill, and some things you don't. See?
Stan
No.
Ned
Moh, only now in this late hour do I see the folly of guns. Mmm, I'll never use a gun again, mmm.
Drops his gun, which fires one last shot as it hits the snow. Kenny is hit.
Kenny
(Oh, no!)
Rats are hot on the trail.
Stan
But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
Jimbo
But Kenny's dead now, Stan, and you're always going to be my nephew. And you can't just kill anything. You understand?
Kyle
Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
Stan
Yeah, [He drops his gun.] it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
Cartman
Yeah, cartoons kick ass! [All three leave.]
	Bus Stop.
Kyle
Hey, where's the school bus? We're gonna be late for football practice.
A dog walks up to the boys.
Stan
Hiya, Sparky.
Kyle
[Looking] Who's that?
Stan
That's my new dog Sparky. He followed me to the bus stop.
Kyle
Wow! Cool!
Stan
Good boy, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's your boy? Who's your buddy?
Cartman
Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
Stan
He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
Cartman
No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
Sylvester
Arrrrrr.
Stan
He's not meaner than Sparky.
Cartman
Oh yeah? Let's see. Hey, Sylvester!
Sylvester comes over.
Stan
Sparky'll kick his ass.
Cartman
I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
Kyle
You're on, dude!
Sylvester starts after Sparky. Both dogs growl.
Stan
That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass!
Sparky lunges after Sylvester and out of view. Aggressive panting can be heard. The boys stand there, shocked.
Cartman
Huh. He's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
Stan
Sparky! Bad dog!
Kenny
(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)
Stan
What?!
Cartman
Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
Stan
What do you mean?
Cartman
That dog is a gay homosexual.
Stan looks back to study the situation, then...
Stan
He's just confused.
Kyle
I think the other dog's the one that's confused.
Kenny
(No, check his penis.)
Kyle smiles.
Stan
Sick, shut up dude!
Sparky pants happily while Sylvester slinks away.
Cartman
Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo.

The bus pulls up.
Football Field, sideline before school.
Chef
Okay children, I know that you're all extremely excited, nervous and anxious about the homecoming game against Middle Park.
Kyle
Who's Middle Park?
Cartman
What's homecoming?
Chef
But just remember what I taught you. That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can't always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. [silence] Now, let's start practice.
Chef blows his whistle, and the kids hit the field.
Pip
Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?
Chef
Yes Pip, what is it?
Pip
Well, I still don't have a helmet.
Chef
I know, Pip, the school can't afford helmets for everybody.
Pip
Yes, but, couldn't we rotate who doesn't have a helmet every week? Does it always have to be me?
Chef
Yes, Pip, I'm afraid it does.
Pip
Oh.
Chef
Sorry son, now get your ass in there.
Out on the playing field.
Stan
Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut. Hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
Chef
[impatiently] Hike the damn ball!
Cartman hikes the ball over Stan's head. Stan chases it down. Kyle runs into Pip, opening a major gash on Pip's head.
Pip
Aaaaaaaargh!
Jimbo and Ned arrive.
Jimbo
Hey, how's practice coming there, Chef?
Chef
[distracted] Huh? Oh, fine, fine.
Jimbo
I don't have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.
Chef
Elementary school alumni?
Jimbo
That's as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?
Chef
I don't know. Wha- what's the spread?
Jimbo
Middle Park by 70 points.
Chef
Hmmm...
They look towards the field, where Kenny tackles Cartman, causing him to drop the ball.
Chef
I don't think we have a chance.
Jimbo
Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. [yells] Right Stanley?
Stan turns to see his uncle just as Cartman hikes.
Stan
Huh?
The ball hits him on the side of the head. He picks it up and throws to Kyle.
Jimbo
Atta boy!
Chef
Great pass, Stan.
Jimbo
Come on Ned, we gotta get our asses to the bookie!
On sideline after practice.
Chef
Okay. That was a good practice children. We'll see you here again tomorrow.
Kyle
Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
Stan
Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
Clyde
Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.
Stan
Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- [sees Sparky lunge after Rex] Sparky, get down!
Clyde
Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!
Cartman
There he goes again.
Stan
Get down, Sparky! Down!
Cartman
Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
Clyde
Make him stop!
Rex moves away with his tail between his legs.
Rex
Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!
Fosse and Bill pass by laughing.
Fosse
I'm sure glad my dog isn't gay.
Bill
Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.
Fosse
Gay dog.
The bullies walk away laughing, while Sparky walks up panting.
Mr. Garrison's classroom. Start of school.
Cartman
...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-.
Cartman
Ah, dammit!
Mr. Garrison
Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?
Mr. Garrison
Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.
Stan
Um, I'm not really prepared either.
Mr. Garrison
Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
Stan
Okay, uh... Asian culture has... plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
Mr. Garrison
Excellent. A-.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Stan
Wow, cool!
Cartman
Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?
Mr. Garrison
Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they're better people.
Cartman
That's not fair!
Mr. Hat
Life isn't fair, kiddo, get used to it.
Cartman
Stupid puppet.
Dismissal bell rings.
Mr. Garrison
Don't forget your assignments tonight children, they're due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.
All students except Stan leave the room.
Stan
Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
Mr. Garrison
Well of course Stanley, what is it?
Stan
What's a... homosexual?
Mr. Garrison
Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.
Stan sits.
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
Stan
I guess.
Mr. Garrison
Good, I'm glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.
Bus stop. The boys get off the bus.
Cartman
You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.
Kyle
You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
Cartman
Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
Stan
Shut up, dude!
Sparky comes up panting with a pink scarf on.
Stan
Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
Sparky
Bark, bark.
Cartman
Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.
Stan
He just needs some training, that's all. Sit, Sparky.
Sparky sits.
Stan
Good boy, now shake.
Sparky shakes.
Stan
Good boy. Now, don't be gay.
Stan waits for the command to sink in.
Stan
Don't be gay, Spark. Don't be gay.
Sparky looks at Stan with confusion and growls.
Kyle
Did it work?
Stan
I don't know.
Cartman
He still looks pretty gay to me.
Bill
Huh, huh.
Fosse
Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?
Bill
Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbara Streisand concert. [they laugh] Stupid little gay dog.
Fosse
Gay dog.
Stan
Come on you guys, I have an idea.
Sports Book, Ned and Jimbo enter. Two big-screen monitors show horse races. One of the five smaller screens above show a race as well.
Jimbo
I want $500 on the South Park Cows.
Bookie
Are you crazy?
Jimbo
No siree. I'm telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they'll beat the spread.
Gambler 1
I want to put all my money on the Cows.
Gambler 2
Duh, duh, I think I'll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it.
Gambler 3
Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.
Female Gambler 1
I got 500 on the Cows.
Female Gambler 2
Well, I'll put my money on the Cows.
Jimbo
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't get too carried away now...
Gambler 4
You better be right about this, Jimbo.
Jimbo
Hehe, yeah. Don't- don't worry yourself.
Ned
Are you sure Stan is that good?
Jimbo
Not that sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let's see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what's the halftime show gonna be?
Bookie
You haven't heard?! John Stamos' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing 'Loving You'.
Ned
I love that song.
Jimbo
'Loving You'? That's perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park's gonna get a Halftime show they'll never forget.
In front of Stan's house, a large crate sits next to the kids.
Stan
Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-
Stan notices a pink scarf on Sparky.
Stan
Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!
He grabs the scarf.
Stan
No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.
The crate opens and Fifi, a French poodle, comes out.
Kyle
Ooh-la-la.
Fifi sniffs some. Sparky starts following her.
Cartman
There he goes!
Stan
Atta boy, Spark! Get her!
Sparky climbs atop Fifi.
Stan
Yes!
Sparky pulls Fifi's collar off and into the air, catching it around his neck.
Stan
Ah crap! Now what do I do?
Kyle
Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
Cartman
No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote the sodomies in France.
Kenny
(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
Stan
I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
Kyle
Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
Stan
Like who?
Inside Stan's house, Jesus and Pals' title screen is on TV.
TV Announcer
And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.
Jesus Christ
Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children. Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions... Hello caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]
Robert
Yeah, is, is this Jesus?
Jesus
Yes my son.
Robert
This, this is Robert from Torrey Pines. I called last week asking for advice on my ex-wife.
Jesus
Of course Robert. How are things now?
Robert
Well, every, everything's much better Jesus. She hasn't mouthed off since- I just wanted to thank you for the advice. Oh, and for, for dying for my sins, that was really nice of you.
Jesus
Blessed art thou, Robert. Next caller, you're on the air. [Beep.]
Stan
Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
Jesus
My son, a lot of people have wondered what my stance on homosexuality is. So I'd like to state once and for all, my true opinion. You see-
The station's logo pops up.
TV Announcer
That's all the time we've left for Jesus and Pals, now stay tuned for Marty's Movie Reviews.
Stan
Damn it!
Kyle
What'd he say?
Stan
I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
Cartman
Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
Stan
Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
Kyle
Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
Stan
No, it's not okay! I don't want a gay dog!
Outside, Sparky overhears this.
Stan
I want a butch dog! I want a Rin-tin-tin!
Sparky grouses, digs a hole, and makes his way out of the yard. He wanders into the mountains, looks back once more, and is gone.
On the sideline at practice.
Chef
Now children, we've got to handle the ball better. You got to hold your football like you hold your lover. [Music starts.] Gently, yet firmly. You wanna be both nurturing and clinging at the same time. Oh yeah! [Sinks into the mood.]
Just like makin' sweet love to the football.
Feelin' naughty with the football.
Mmmm.

Kyle
Uh, Chef?
Chef
Spank it, ever so gently.

Kyle
Chef.
Chef
Spank it.

Kyle
Chef!
Chef
Oh, uhuhh, sorry children. Uhuh, let's run some plays.
Pip
Uh, Mr. Chef sir?
Chef
No Pip, we still don't have a helmet for you.
Pip
Righto, but how about I use a helmet today, and one of the other children goes without?
Chef
That wouldn't be very fair to the other children, now would it?
Pip
No um, I guess not.
Carl's Bombs And Explosives and Accessories.
Jimbo
What we wanna do here, Carl, is put a trigger on that bomb that makes it go off at a specific moment during halftime.
Carl
What moment would that be?
Jimbo
Well, John Stamos' older brother is all set to sing 'Loving You' during halftime. We want that bomb to go off when he hits that high F.
Carl
What high F?
Jimbo
You know,
Loving you is easy 'cause you're beautiful doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo... Aaaaah.

Carl
Right, right, so you want the trigger on the doo-nn-doo?
Jimbo
No, dammit! The aaaaah!
Carl
Aaaaahh?
Ned
Aaaaahh.
Jimbo
Aaaaahh!
Carl
Aaaaahh.
Jimbo
Great.
Carl
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo - Aaah.
Ned
Doo-nn-doo-doo
Jimbo
You got it.
Carl
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-doo...
Ned
Aaa - dooo...
Jimbo
Aaaaahh!
Carl
Alright, yeah, okay...
On the sideline at practice.
Chef
What's the matter Stan, you seem down.
Stan
I just, I can't concentrate 'cause my dog is gay.
Chef
Well, you know what they say: you can't teach a gay dog straight tricks.
Coming up to see what's the matter.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
Chef
Say what?! You of all people should be sympathetic.
Mr. Garrison
What do you mean?
Chef
Well, you're gay aren't you?
Mr. Garrison
What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
Chef
Well, you sure do act like it.
Mr. Garrison
I just act that way to get chicks, dumbass.
Chef looks puzzled, wondering.
On the field.
Kyle runs up from behind.
Kyle
What's the matter dude?
Stan
I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
Cartman
Maybe he went shopping for some leather pants. [Stan punches him] Ow!
Snowy mountains. Sparky is trekking through the snow, stops, and looks around. A floating castle nears him. It's Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
Big Gay Al
Hello there little pup, I'm Big Gay Al.
Sparky looks at him.
Big Gay Al
Have you been outcast?
Sparky pants an affirmative.
Big Gay Al
Well, then I'm so glad you found my Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. We're all big gay friends here. Would you like to live with us?
Sparky pants an affirmative.
Big Gay Al
Come on in little fellow, nobody will ever oppress you here.
Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman are at the Bus Stop. Stan walks up.
Stan
Have you guys seen Sparky, he still hasn't come back.
Kyle
Wow, it's been like two days.
Stan
I think he might've run away.
Cartman
Did you check the shopping ma- [Stan punches him] Ow!
Kyle
We'll help you look for him after the game, Stan.
Stan
I'm not playing.
Kyle
You what?!
Stan
I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. [leaves]
Middle Park Elementary School.
Jimbo
[whispering] Come on Ned, and keep quiet.
Ned
[louder] Okay.
They climb over the fence and approach the Middle Park mascot, a horse.
Jimbo
Hello there, Enrique.
Ned
What are we doing here?
Jimbo
Well Ned, we always kidnap Middle Park's mascot. But this year, we're gonna booby-trap it instead.
Jimbo puts the bomb on Enrique's back.
Jimbo
And when John Stamos' older brother hits that high F in "Loving You", Boom!
Enrique gets wide-eyed.
Jimbo
No more Middle Park players.
Jimbo and Ned laugh, and Enrique starts to tremble.
Jimbo
God damn, I love football!
Stan is in the stormy mountains.
Stan
Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
South Park Elementary.
The Middle Park Cowboys exit the bus.
Cowboys
Kill that Ken! Kill that Ken!
South Park Football Field. The bleachers are filled with fans decked out in COWS! gear. Even Ike is wearing a GO COWS shirt and bouncing about.
Frank Hammond
Hello everyone, this is Frank Hammond, South Park public radio, AM 900, Welcome to tonight's match-up between the Middle Park Cowboys and the South Park Cows.
Pounds the table, and Phil's mike falls over. He scans the sidelines.
Frank
Well, it looks like Chef, the South Park Cows coach, looks a little nervous. This is probably because his star quarterback has yet to show up.
Chef
[between his teeth] Oohh, come on, Stan...
Pip
Uh, Mr. Chef, if Stanley doesn't show up, can I use his helmet?
Chef
No Pip, I'm sorry!
Stormy mountains.
Stan
Sparky! Sparky!
South Park Football Field, first quarter. The game is about to begin.
Referee
Play ball.
Chef
You're gonna have to quarterback, Kyle.
Kyle
But I never practiced quarterback.
Chef
Well it's a little late for that bullcrap now.
Frank
Filling in for quarterback is number 12, Kyle Broslovski.
Mr. Garrison
Hey hey, where is little Stanley?
Mr. Hat
Yeah, why the hell is that little Jewish kid playing quarterback?
Jimbo
Ned, look!
Middle Park's mascot, Enrique, is shown.
Jimbo
They've got Enrique on their sidelines, and it looks like that bomb's still attached.
Ned
Yay.
Stan follows his dog's footprints and finds himself facing Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
Big Gay Al
Hi little fella, how are you doing today?
Stan
Fine, how are you?
Big Gay Al
I'm super, thanks for asking.
Stan
My gay dog ran away and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
Big Gay Al
Well, let's see. Come on in. [they enter]
Stan
Do you have lots of gay dogs here?
Big Gay Al
We have all sorts of gay animals here at Big Gay Al's. Over here we have a gay lion.
Gay Lion
Rooaar.
Big Gay Al
And we have gay water buffalo, gay hummingbirds, here's a gaggle of gay gooses. Hi fellas, it's so super to see you!
Stan
Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
Big Gay Al
Of course they are, silly buns. It's the one place where gay animals can really be themselves. Do you like to dance?
They enter the techno-dance floor as disco music plays. Animals pour in to dance, even a dolphin on its tail.
Vocalist
Oww, we can both be gay!

In the huddle. The Cows win the coin toss.
Kyle
Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it or something. Ready?!
Huddle
Break!
At the line of scrimmage.
Cowboy 1
You guys are toast.
Cowboy 2
Yeah, we're gonna pound your heads in.
Cartman
We'll just see about that.
Kyle
Set, set.
Cartman farts long and nasty right into Kyle's face. Kyle quickly retreats.
Kyle
Damn it Cartman!
Chef
What's the matter?
Kyle
Cartman farted!
Cartman
No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
Chef
Come on Kyle. We'll get a delay of game penalty.
Kyle
No way dude!
Chef
Hike! The! Ball!
Kyle is back in position, with his shirt covering his nose.
Kyle
Ah, dude, weak.
Cartman
That's right, you get back there.
Kyle
Hike!
Frank
Ball snatched! Middle Park blitzes!
Screaming as Kyle is tackled.
Frank
Fumble, Middle Park gets the ball. They run it in for a TOUCHDOWN! The score is 7-nothing Middle Park, with 14:57 remaining in the first quarter.
Jimbo
Hell's bells.
Frank
Why, I haven't seen a beating like that since Rodney King.
Phil quickly covers the mic.
Phil
Now Frank, that's not very PC. You're gonna get us in trouble again.
Frank
Right, right, uh. I gotta watch that.
Townsman 1
We lose our money 'cause of your nephew, we're gonna hang you up to dry, Jimbo.
Jimbo
Don't y'all worry, you just wait till halftime, heheh.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Dance Floor.
Vocalist
...both be gay.

Stan is dancing with a monkey, then sees Sparky.
Stan
Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
Sparky
Ruff.
Stan
I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
Sparky
Barr.
Stan
Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.
Sparky follows Stan.
Stan
We can work on making you not gay together.
Sparky stops and sits.
Stan
Sparky?
Big Gay Al
Young man, it appears you still don't understand.
Stan
What don't I understand?
Big Gay Al
Come this way, I have to show you something.
South Park Football Field, second quarter.
Frank
With just over a minute to go in the half the score is Middle Park Cowboys 52, South Park Cows 0.
Kyle
Hut, hut.
Cartman snaps the ball to Kyle. The Cowboys blitz. Kyle flips the ball back to Pip, who is still without a helmet. The Cowboys players descend on him as soon as he catches the ball.
Frank
Oh no, I haven't seen an Englishman take a blow like that since Hugh Grant.
Phil muffles Frank.
Phil
Dude! Now that is not cool.
Frank
Sorry, sorry.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.
Big Gay Al
Okay Stan, I think you should get in line for my Big Gay Boat Ride.
Stan looks at the boat.
Big Gay Al
Step aboard, Stanley.
He and Sparky step aboard the boat.
Big Gay Al
Hello everyone, and welcome aboard the Big Gay Boat Ride. On this adventure, we'll be seeing the world of gayness throughout time.
South Park Football Field. South Park's final drive before the halftime show.
Frank
And the South Park Cows are set to receive...
The Cowboys kick off.
Frank
There's the kick. It's taken by number 23, Kenny McCormick.
Kenny weaves through the special teams.
Frank
He's at the 50, the 40, the 30.
Cowboys
Hold him, hold him!
Two of them take hold of Kenny's arms.
Cowboys
Hold him, hold him!
Cowboy
Yaaah!
A Third Cowboy dives in, taking Kenny's head off, as the other two sever Kenny's arms.
Frank
The little running back is down. I think he's...
Rats come in to devour Kenny's corpse.
Frank
Yes, he's been decapitated.
Kyle
[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Phil
Hah, that's gotta hurt, Frank.
Frank
Ouch-a-roo!
Chef
Hey, come on! That was roughing! At least let us scrape him off the field!
Frank
Looks like the South Park Cows aren't even gonna beat the 72 point spread, not by a long shot.
Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride.
The boat-ride begins the passage through several animatronic scenes.
Big Gay Al
You see, gayness has existed since the beginning of time. From the Egyptian pharaohs, to the shoguns of Japan.
The tips of the Japanese soldiers' swords touch.
Big Gay Al
Uh oh, look out, it's the oppressors! Christians and Republicans and Nazis, oh my!
Big Gay Al fires off a shot with his pistol.
Big Gay Al
Whoa! Oh gosh, that was close. Okay, let's steer our Big Gay Boat out of here, and into a place where gays are allowed to live freely.
Doors open to reveal a scene reminiscent of 'It's a Small World'.
Boat Ride Singers
We're all gay, and it's okay,
'Cause gay means happy and happy means gay.
We're not sad anymore, cause we're out the closet door.
It's okay, hey, to be gay!

Big Gay Al
Sooo, what do you think, Stan?
Still singing.
...It's okay to be gay...

Stan
This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you, Spark. I just didn't understand.
Still singing.
It's okay to be gay. Shalala waylaylay shalala waylaylay. It's okay to be gay.

Big Gay Al
[to himself] Isn't this precious?
South Park Football Field. Halftime.
Frank
And now, here to sing the touching song Loving You, is the one and only, John Stamo-...s' brother...
Audience Member
Alright Richard!
Music starts up.
Richard Stamos
Loving you,
is easy cause you're beautiful,
-doo-n-doo-doo-doooo-
Aaaaah!

His voice cracks and the music stops.
Richard
Aaaaah!

Jimbo
What the hell?!
Richard
Aaaaah!

His voice wavers.
Jimbo
He didn't sing the high F!
Mr. Garrison
Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
Jimbo
Ned... We're gonna to get our asses kicked.
Richard
Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala la la lala...

Mr. Garrison
[heckling] It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
Outside of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary.
Stan
Thanks for everything, Big Gay Al!
Sparky
Ruff!
Big Gay Al
No problem, kids! Are you sure you don't wanna stay for some toasted cheese sandwiches?
Stan
No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy!
They start to walk off.
Big Gay Al
Oh Stan?
They stop.
Big Gay Al
When you get back to town, [earnest music plays] tell them about us, will you? Tell them there are gay animals here who need homes, desperately.
Stan
I will Big Gay Al, I will.
They depart.
Bell dings.
Big Gay Al
Ooh, my carrot cake! [rushes inside]
South Park Football Field, fourth quarter.
Kyle
Hike!
Frank
And these South Park Cows are being absolutely molested by Middle Park. I haven't seen so many children molested since...
Mr. Garrison
I thought you said beating the spread was a sure thing, Jimbo.
Mr. Hat
Yeah, we all put our life savings in this game.
Townsman
You're a dead man, Jimbo!
A hail of food products is thrown at Jimbo.
Frank
Well, this should just about wrap it up for-
Stan and Sparky come onto the field.
Frank
Wait a minute, what's this?
Jimbo
Yeah! Yohooooh!
Frank
It's Stan, the South Park star quarterback!
Chef
Where the hell have you been Stan?!
Stan
I've been getting my best friend back.
Chef
Just get in there boy!
Jimbo
Give 'em hell, Stanley!
Stan takes his place on the field as Jimbo looks to the heavens, and prays aloud to himself.
Jimbo
Jesus? Now I haven't asked you for much, but all we need is one little score. Please? Please, Jesus?
In the first row of the stands.
Jesus
Leave me alone.
Stan
Hike!
Frank
Stan hikes the ball. He steps back to pass.
Kyle
Hey Stan! Ah, I'm open, I think!
Stan
Mph!
Stan throws the ball.
Frank
And he throws it to Kyle, the little Jewish kid!
Kyle
Oof.
Kyle runs towards the end zone, panting, Cowboys hot on his trail.
Frank
Oh my! I haven't seen a Jew run like that since Poland, 1938!
Frank recoils.
Phil
Dude!
The crowd cheers as Kyle scores.
Frank
Touchdown!
Jimbo
Yeah! Wooo!
Frank
The clock runs out and the final score is Middle Park Cowboys 73, South Park Cows 6. South Park beats the spread!
Frank swats his mic away.
Jimbo
Yeah! Woohoo!
Postgame press conference. Stan gets on stage by scoreboard.
Townsman
Speech!
Frank
Stan, what do you want to tell the world about this stunning almost victory?
Stan
Uh... It- it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
Crowd
Yeah, alright!
Stan
And maybe... we can beat 'em even more next year!
Crowd
Wooooh!
Stan
And it's okay to be gay!
The crowd falls silent.
Jimbo
What?!
Stan
Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is he talking about?
Frank
Uh, Stanley, you arrived very late in the game, where were you that whole time?
Stan
I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.
The crowd looks at Stan in disbelief.
Stan
It's true, I'll show you.
At the site of Big Gay Al's Big Gay Animal Sanctuary. There is nothing to be seen.
Stan
But it was here. It was all right here. There- there was a techno dance club...
Cartman
Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man.
The missing animals suddenly appear.
Townswoman
Oliver! I thought you ran away all those months ago!
Townsperson 1
Sidney!
Townsperson 2
Willy!
Townsperson 3
Carlos!
Big Gay Al is suddenly at Stan's side.
Big Gay Al
I want to thank you so much for bringing everybody here.
Stan
Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
Big Gay Al
I'm super, thanks for asking. It looks like now my work here is done.
He pops his suitcase open and climbs into it.
Big Gay Al
Goodbye Stanley, peace be with you.
He presses a button, and the suitcase closes.
Stan
Wow!
The suitcase flies off.
Richard
You guys, you guys! I can do it.
Mr. Garrison
Do what?
Richard
Loving you,
Is easy cause you're beautiful,
Doo-nn-doo-nn-doo-dooo

Jimbo
No!
Richard
Aaah!

Enrique
Mroo-
BOOM!
	Bus Stop.
Cartman
Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
Stan
Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
Cartman
Your sister beat you up again, huh?
Stan
No!
Cartman
Eheh, you know, heh, your sister kicked your ass.
Stan
She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist. She's taking it out on me.
Kyle
Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
Cartman
I would never let a woman kick my ass. If she tried anything, I'd be like, "hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!"
Stan
My parents don't even believe that she beats me up. They think she's all innocent and sweet, but I know that she's an evil bitch!
Cartman
Be a man Stan. Just say, "Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies."
Stan
Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
The camera pulls back to get the elephant in the picture.
Kyle
You mean this one?
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
He's my new pet elephant.
Stan
Whoa dude! Where'd you get a pet elephant?
Kyle
I got it mail ordered from Africa. The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
Stan
Wow, that's cool!
Kyle
No it's not cool! My mom won't let me keep him in the house. She says he's too big, and that his poop is bigger than our couch.
Cartman
That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig. Cause its poop is small.
Kenny
(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
Stan
Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
Ms. Crabtree's bus arrives.
Ms. Crabtree
Hey. Wait a minute. What is that thing?
Kyle
Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh—I'm sorry little girl. But you still can't get on. You have to take the special ed bus.
Shot of retarded kid bus. Retarded noises of protest are heard.
Kyle
Boy, it looks like you're not welcome anywhere elephant. See ya.
He enters the bus with Stan and Kenny.
Cartman
[Entering.] If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, "Hey, you go do my laundry and-"
Ms. Crabtree
SIT DOWN KID!!!
Cartman
[Stung.] Yes ma'am.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom.
Mr. Garrison
And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
Mr. Hat
That's right Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering is an exciting new science. You can splice the DNA from some animals, and make them better.
Kyle
Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Yes Kyle.
Kyle
With genetic engineering, can you make an elephant smaller?
Mr. Garrison
Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could. You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
Kyle
That's it. I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make...pot-bellied elephants.
The class gasps.
Kyle
They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
Stan
That'd be cool!
Bebe
I want a pot-bellied elephant.
Pip
Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.
Terrance Mephesto
That's stupid.
Kyle
Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
Terrance
Oh yeah, I bet I can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig.
Kyle
I'll bet you can't.
Terrance
Watch me plebeian.
Mr. Garrison
Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie. Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.
Mr. Hat
Yes Mr. Garrison, genetic engineering lets us correct God's horrible, horrible mistakes, like German people.
Mr. Garrison
You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help. And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month.
The bell rings. Most of the class leaves, but the boys stay behind.
Kyle
Genetic Engineering Ranch! Sweet!
Stan
Wait, wait. We still need a pig.
Kyle
We can use Cartman's pig.
Cartman
Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
Kyle
We're not gonna hurt her, we just need some of her blood.
Cartman
You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts. Kyle, Kyle no!
The boys leave.
Mr. Garrison steps forward to stop Stan.
Mr. Garrison
Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?
Stan
Okay.
Mr. Garrison
I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have. Are there problems at home?
Stan
[Despondantly.] Yes...
Mr. Garrison
Oh dear. Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it.
Stan sits down.
Mr. Hat
I'm your friend, Mr. Hat, Stan. You can tell me anything. Now, who hits you, is it your father, or your mother?
Stan
Oh, neither. It's my sister.
Mr. Garrison
[Indignantly.] Your sister?! Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss. Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!
Stan's house. A TV is heard.
Jesus
Let's open the phone lines back up for some questions...
Shelly turns to see Stan coming out of the sofa's shadow.
Shelly Marsh
Hey!
Robert
Yeah, is this Jesus?
Jesus
Yes, my son.
Stan
Hi Shelly.
Shelly
Are you looking at my headgear?
Stan
Headgear? What headgear?
Shelly
Are you looking at my headgear?
Stan
Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
Shelly gets up and glowers at him.
Shelly
You little liar.
She starts advancing, and Stan starts retreating.
Stan
No, I think it looks terrific. It matches your AAAAAH!
Stan turns to run, but she has his arm, she proceeds to beat the living hell out of him. She tosses him down the stairs into the basement, then approaches the doorway. He climbs out, but she flips him back towards the living room, then goes for the TV and drops it on his head. After the TV shorts out, he removes it, but she throws him like a basketball out the window, where his friends are waiting.
Kyle
Ready to go Stan?
Stan
Go where?
Kyle
To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
Kyle
We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
Cartman
Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
From the broken window.
Shelly
I swear I'm gonna kill you Stan!
Kyle
Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
Cartman
Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, "Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!"
She appears at the broken window.
Shelly
Who said that?
All stay quiet. Cartman points to Kenny.
South Park Engineering Ranch, night. The boys approach the entrance.
Kyle
This must be it.
Lightning strikes the ranch.
Cartman
[A bit wary.] Well, looks like nobody's home. Guess we should come back some other time.
Kyle
No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
Cartman
It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
Kyle
It's just a stupid pig.
Stan
Yeah, quit being such a baby.
Cartman
Baby?! Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
Stan
At least I'm not a little pig-fucker!
Cartman
Hey! I'm taking my pig and...Screw you guys! I'm going home! This whole idea's stupid anyway.
Kyle
What the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
Cartman
Hey! Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
Kyle
There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
Cartman
I'll kick you in the nuts!
Dr. Alphonse Mephesto
Can I help you?
The boys all gasp, and Kenny pulls his hood closed.
Kenny
Mmmmmm!
Kyle
Uh... yeah... we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
Mephesto
Brilliant idea, huge elephant-sized pigs.
Kyle
No, no, no. We want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets.
Mephesto
Ohh, that's an even better idea. Come on in.
Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.
Mephesto
I'm so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering.
Cartman
Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
Mephesto
It's thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger, disease, pollution, even war. I have created things that will change the world for the better. For instance, here is a monkey with four asses.
Monkey
Mhhh.
Kyle
How does that make the world better?
Mephesto
And here, of course, is my four assed ostrich. And my four assed mongoose.
Stan
Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
Mephesto
Oh, uh, I suppose so uh. Oh yes, over here. Here I have rats splice with ducks, and gorillas spliced with mosquitos, and here I have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish.
Cartman
Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
Mephesto
And over here, Swiss cheese spliced with chalk, and a beard.
Kyle
Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
Mephesto
Oh. Well I'm sorry children, but, pig and elephant DNA just won't splice. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
Kyle
Which song is that?
Mephesto
Diindoon - pig and elephant DNA just won't splice!

Although, maybe I could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours.

Cartman
You can keep your hands off of Fluffy's ass!
Mephesto
You know, it's amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days.
Mephesto pricks Stan with the syringe.
Stan
Ow!
Mephesto
Hmm? What? Oh, excuse me.
Kyle
Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
Mephesto
Oh, pardon me, I tripped. Could I have some hair please?
Kyle
Watch out Stan! Genetic engineers are crazy.
The boys quickly move away.
Cartman
Come on Fluffy!
Fluffy Squeals.
Inside the Cafeteria.
Kid 1
This fish is just hurting my anus.
Kid 2
Naw, it's pretty fresh.
Cartman
UUuuhh. I sure am hungry.
Pip
'Ello gentlemen, any of you blokes know what's for lunch today?
Silence. The boys stare back.
Pip
Lunchy munchies, hmmm?
Cartman
Go away, Pip! Nobody likes you!
Kyle
Yeah, what kind of name is Pip anyway?!
Pip
Well, my father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name being Phillip, my infant tongue...
Cartman
God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?! Nobody gives a rat's ass.
Stan
Yeah! Go away, Pip!
Pip
Righto.
Pip walks off.
Cartman
Gah, French people piss me off.
Terrance, Bill, & Fosse Approach.
Terrance
Hey dumb-asses. You morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet?
Kyle
No! We're already halfway done.
Terrance
Halfway? Then all you've got is a stupid pig.
Bill
Yeah, it's probably a gay pig too.
Fosse
Stupid gay pig.
Kyle
It's more than you've got!
Terrance
Wroong. We've already got our human clone well under way.
One of the bullies opens a bag and drops it. A foot pops out.
Kyle
Oh my God! They cloned a foot.
The foot kicks Cartman in the face.
Cartman
Ugh!... Hey! I'll kick your ass!
Cartman kicks it away, and it lands in Pip's lunch tray and bounces away.
Pip
Eho!
Terrance
By Friday, we're gonna clone a whole human being. Good luck with your stupid little pig.
In the kitchen
Chef
Hello there children.
Kyle
Hey Chef.
Chef
How you doin'?
Boys
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
Chef
Ahhhh, of course they won't splice children. Haven't you ever heard that song by 'Loverboy'?
Chef
Dooodnnndoodnn - A pig and an elephant DNA just won't...

A pig-elephant. Say, now that's not a bad idea.

Kyle
I told you guys.
Chef
Imagine, a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house. Children, we could make a fortune with this.
Kyle
You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
Chef
Forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge. If you want to combine a pig and an elephant, just get them to make sweeet love.
Cartman
Whaaat?!
Stan
I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
Cartman
I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
Chef
Sure they would. But you're gonna have to get 'em in the mood.
Stan
So how do we do that?
Chef
Do what I do, get 'em goood and drunk.
Boys get off the bus later that day.
Stan
Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
Kyle
We've got work to do Stan, I think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk.
Stan
Really, you, you guys don't want to come over for just a little bit?
Cartman
Why? Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
Stan
Shut up Cartman!
Kenny
(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
Kyle
Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
Cartman
Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, "hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"
Astonished looks from the other guys.
Stan
Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
Cartman
I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
Kyle
Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly. The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, "Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you."
Kenny
("And I want to see you handling your breasts.")
Stan
Sick dude, she's my sister.
Kyle
Try it. We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
Cartman
No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig! You leave Fluffy out of this!
Kyle
Come on Kenny.
Cartman
Kyle no, seriously. No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I... Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
Stan
Crap.
Stan's house. Stan sneaks through the front door.
TV Voice
And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park Public Access...
Shelly
Are you staring at my neck-brace?
Stan
No, I mean, yes, I mean, what neck-brace?
She jumps off the sofa and grabs him by the throat.
Stan
Shelly, before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again, I just want you to know that... that you're my sister, and I love you.
Shelly smiles, Stan smiles, it looks like she's gonna let him go... yeah, right! She throws him off to a clear space on the floor, where he lies defeated.
Stan
No. Ahh! Someday, Shelly, I'm gonna be bigger than you, and you're gonna wish you'd never done any of this to me.
Shelly
You'll never be bigger than me Stan. Never!
Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch.
Mephesto is marveling at his creation.
Mephesto
Beautiful, it's absolutely beautiful. My son, I think we've finally done it.
A fetal version of Stan is seen in the incubator.
Terrance
Yes, we have dad. My very own human clone.
Bill
Hopefully not a gay clone.
Fosse
Yeah, that was stupid.
Bill
Stupid.
Fosse
That was stupid.
Out in the hills somewhere, Kyle is pumping a keg that the elephant is drinking from.
Kyle
Come on elephant, keep drinking.
Stan
Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig.
Fluffy is drinking from a trough labeled "Beer".
Kyle
Dammit! This is never gonna work.
Chef comes into view.
Chef
Hello children. I thought I'd check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going.
Kyle
Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
Chef
Ohh, children, you just can't stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant, and, and, expect them to do the mattress mambo. You need to set the mood.
He moves over to a boombox with a mic attached.
Chef
Let me show you boys what I'm talking about.
Tonight is a-right for love,
you know I -- want tuh touch you where the lights don't go.
Tonight is a-right for love, love gravy.
Expressing love so sweet.
I want tuh -- keep you burnin' like a dog in heat.
Tonight is a-right for love, love graaavaaay.

The elephant and pig approach each other. Fluffy smiles at the elephant, then turns around in order to receive him.
Chef
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!
Enter Elton John. Intermingled shots of Fluffy and elephant getting interested.
Elton John
Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy.

The boys applaud
Chef
Thank you Elton.
slowing the tempo. Houses all over the hill show couples embracing.
Chef
Tonight is right for love, love graaavaaaaaay.

Elephant is about to mount Fluffy.
Kyle
Hey look! It's working.
Chef
Now children, gather around, and watch the wonders of life. The beauty of Mother Nature.
Squish. Squeals follow.
Kyle
Aah!
Stan
Sick!
Cartman
Fluffy!
Chef
Hmm, now I know how all those white women must have felt.
Squealing continues.
Inside the South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. A big mutant version of Stan is in the incubator, with a very long left arm.
Mephesto
How luscious. Our creature has come to fruition, boys.
Terrance
Dad, you're the best.
Mephesto
Oh my God! He only has one ass. He's of no use to me, I'll have to burn the room.
Big Stan breaks out of the incubator.
Mephesto
Oh no, this entire experiment is turning out very bad.
Big Stan
Me bad??
Big Stan throws four-assed frog against wall, killing it.
Mephesto
Eeegads, he's out of control. We'll have to destroy him.
Terrance
But he's our science fair project!
Big Stan
Uhhh, me baad, aba-ba-chewy-chomp.
Mephesto
He's too dangerous son.
Terrance
But dad! I want a human clone.
Mephesto
Son, no.
Big Stan jumps through window, then tears down the ranch gate entrance.
Mephesto
Oh son, you've made a horrible mistake. You've put all the people of South Park in jeopardy.
Terrance
They're all stupid anyway. Come on guys, let's go.
Bill
Yeahh, they're all gay.
Back on the Hill. Shot of Fluffy and elephant sleeping together.
Kyle
Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
Chef
Oh, they will. It's gonna be one uuuugly sight.
Kyle
I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
Stan
Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
Chef
Usually about 9:30 in the morning, children.
The elephant begins to wake up.
Chef
Uh oh, here we go.
Elephant looks down at Fluffy with surprise and bellows.
Chef
Yeahhh, there's nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig.
Fluffy looks up at elephant, begins crying.
Chef
Or a big fat elephant.
Kyle
Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
Chef
Well boys, we might not know that for a couple of days.
Kyle
Couple of days? But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
Cartman
Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?
Kyle punches Cartman.
Cartman
Hey!
Mephesto approaches.
Mephesto
Oh thank Buddha I found you boys. You must tell me, have you seen anything odd lately?
Stan
Uh, we saw an elephant have sex with a pig.
Mephesto
No, no, I said odd.
Chef
Hey, you're that crazy cracker from up on the hill.
Mephesto
Sir, if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy... then... uhhhhh... hmmm... oh, nevermind. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an incident at the ranch. You see, I've created a large mutant clone of that little boy there, and he's broken free.
Kenny
(A big mutant Stan?!)
Stan
A big mutant version of me?
Kyle
Is he bigger than a regular clone?
Mephesto
He's terribly dangerous. His brain is identical to yours. I need you to help me find him.
Downtown South Park. Big Stan is wreaking havoc on the town. People are running in fear. Big Stan has a car in one hand, he's destroying it. A woman screams. Big Stan tosses car aside effortlessly.
Big Stan
Ah chewy-chewy-chomp.
Woman
Oh my Gooodd!
Mr. Garrison
Stan, are you wearing a different hat?
Big Stan
Uhhhyahhuhhh.
picks up Mr. Garrison and begins beating him against the ground
Mr. Garrison
Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.
Big Stan throws Mr. Garrison aside.
Mr. Garrison
Aaaaaah!
Mr. Garrison flies through Jimbo's Guns window.
Mr. Garrison
Ooooh.
Boys in Downtown South Park.
Kyle
How big do you think he is?
Stan
I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
Kyle
Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
Kenny
(Look at that! What's he doin'?)
Stan
Oh my God!
Townsman
Aaaah!
Big Stan is running by with two people in his arms.
Newscaster on TV.
Tom
It appears that the horrible, destructive creature is actually eight-year old Stan Marsh of South Park. When asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town, the little boy replies simply, "Me Stan, ba-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp, ba-chewy-chomp. Back to you in the studio.
TV Newscaster
Thanks Tom, police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body. That's all for now.

On the streets of South Park. Officer Barbrady is directing traffic.
Stan
Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town. We have to find him.
Officer Barbrady
You boys have been watching the "X-Files" too much, there's no such thing as genetic clone -
Big Stan
Ahhhh.
Big Stan grabs Officer Barbrady and throws him into nearby pond.
Officer Barbrady
Whoa! [From under the surface.] Listen, uh, you kids go on home, there's nothing to see here.
Kyle
Come on, let's go!
Stan's Uncle Jimbo approaches.
Jimbo
There you are! Stanley, you tore up my entire gun shop, you better have a good explanation for this mister!
Stan
It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
Mr. Garrison walks up looking like hell.
Mr. Garrison
Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?! You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!
Jimbo
I'm gonna go have a word with your father Stanley.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, you wait 'til your father hears about this.
Kyle
Wait, Stan, there he goes.
Stan
Stop!
Big Stan
Ahhh, ba-ba-chomp?
Kyle
He recognizes you dude.
Stan
That's good, that's good dude. Just calm down.
Big Stan is now seated in the road.
Big Stan
Ba-chomp, eh mee ahh jaran.
Kyle
What should we do with him?
Stan looks at Big Stan, then smiles mischievously.
Stan
Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
Big Stan
Ahhhh, yeahhh.
Outside Stan's house. The boys and Big Stan approach the front door. Sparky can be seen off to the side.
Stan
...So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back. When you see Shelly, kick her ass. Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
Big Stan
Me bad??
Stan
No! Shelly bad, you good.
Big Stan proceeds to destroy the house.
Stan
He's tearing up the house, stop him!
Big Stan is hitting a chair against the ground. Kenny runs towards Big Stan, who uses the chair to chuck him into the microwave in the kitchen. The microwave starts up, cooking Kenny.
Stan
Come on Kyle, Cartman.
The boys run at Big Stan, and he knocks each one aside.
Big Stan
Ah.
Shelly
What the hell do you want?
Big Stan
Chewy-chewy-chomp.
Shelly head butts him onto the ground.
Big Stan
Ahhh. Uhhh.
Mephesto rushes in followed shortly by Terrance with Bill & Fosse.
Mephesto
Boys! Boys, I'm lusciously sorry for everything.
Terrance
Hey, they've got our clone. He belongs to us.
Mephesto
No son, this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere. Boys, I'm sorry I've caused you such - inconvenience. I tried to play God, and I failed.
Mephesto shoots Big Stan through the head.
Terrance
Daddy! Nooooo!
Mephesto
All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn't be toying with God's creations. Perhaps we should just leave nature alone, to its simple one assed schematics.
Terrance
You cheating bastards. This isn't over, just wait until tomorrow.
Kyle just now noticed something.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
Stan sees his parents drive up.
Stan
Mom and dad are home. My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
Cartman
I ain't helpin' crap! I want to eat some paeh.
Stan
You can't just leave me here alone.
Cartman
Oh yeah, watch me. [Zips away.]
Kyle
Yeah Stan, we have to go find out if Cartman's pig is pregnant or not. See ya. [Leaves.]
Stan
Thanks a lot.
Shelly
Ohh boy, you are gonna get it now.
Jimbo and Mr. Garrison are shown outside, talking to Stan's parents.
Stan
It isn't fair! Everybody hates me! The whole town wants me killed! Mom and dad are gonna send me away! I don't want to be sent away! I want to stay here! Eehhhehehe!
Randy and Sharon enter.
Randy
Stanley, what, what in God's name have you been doing?
Sharon Marsh
Everybody in town is upset with you young man. What's going on? Are you on drugs?
Shelly
It's not Stan's fault.
Randy
Huh?
Shelly
It wasn't Stan, he was... it was with me the whole time.
Randy
Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
Sharon
Oh honey, please forgive us son.
Stan
Shelly, you, you saved my life. And yet, you've done so much more than that. Today you've taught me the meaning of family. Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.
Shelly begins beating the crap out of Stan.
Stan
Uh, ahh, oooh.
rats drag away Kenny's charred corpse as Shelly takes a lawnmower to Stan's face.
Mr. Garrison's Class. The science projects are due.
Mr. Garrison
Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.
Only Clyde claps.
Mr. Garrison
Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
Kyle
Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'. Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.
Terrance
Thank you Mr. Garrison. Boys, Mr. Garrison, fellow students, for our science fair project Bill, Fosse, and I have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man. I present to you, the five-assed monkey.
Shot of Monkey with five asses.
Monkey
Ahhheh.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful.
More students clap.
Stan
Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth. It, it had a baby!
Kid 1
It had a baby?
Kid 2
Oh wow!
Clyde
What's it look like?
Kyle
Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
Cartman
Hey, it kind of looks like Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence? Hmm, what are the odds of that?
Hat
Hmmm. You boys get first prize.
Cartman
That'll do pig.
	Stan's House.
Marsh Family
Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear grandpa...

Marvin "Grandpa" Marsh
Uhhhhh.
Marsh Family
...Happy birthday to you.

Sharon
Now blow out the candles grandpa.
Grandpa blows, but nothing comes out but a low moan.
Sharon
Hurray!!!
Randy
How's it feel to be 102, paps?
Grandpa
Shoot me.
Sharon
Make a wish grandpa.
Grandpa
I wish I were dead
Randy
Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grandpa.
Grandpa
I'm not being silly! Kill me. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damn old.
Sharon
Ooh, who wants ice cream with their cake?
Shelly
I will.
Randy
Me.
Stan
It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
Shelly
That showsh for babiesh, it'sh show shtupid.
Stan
Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
Sharon
Oh, alright, but take your grandpa with you.
Stan
Aw, dammit!
Sharon
Language.
In front of the TV. Stan has his slice of cake with him.
TV Announcer
And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
Phillip
Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart.
Terrance
Wait, before you do, pull my thumb.
Phillip pulls, and Terrance lets loose with a juicy fart. They both laugh.
Stan
Heheheh hehehe...
Grandpa
Uhhhhh
Grandpa lines a shotgun up to his face, but it leaves a big hole in the picture behind him when he shoots.
Grandpa
Ah, dammit!
Stan looks at him.
Granpa
How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
Stan
My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan.
Grandpa
Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?
Stan
Sure.
Grandpa
Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
Stan
I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.
Grandpa
Why not?
Stan
'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
Grandpa
I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
Stan
Leave me alone grandpa.
On the TV there's a fart, and more laughter.
Grandpa
What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
Kyle's House. Ike and Kyle are watching 'Terrance & Phillip'
Phillip
Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too.
Phillip farts, and they laugh.
Terrance
Ohhh, you farted.
Kyle is laughing pretty hard.
Sheila Broflovski
Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?
Terrance
Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?
Phillip
I sure would Terrance.
Terrance
Alrighty then, here's a two-lip.
Terrance farts, and they laugh.
Sheila
What is this?
Kyle falls off the armchair laughing.
Sheila
It's horrible!
Kyle gets up off the floor.
Kyle
Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
Phillip knocks Terrance's head to one side.
Phillip
Take that you stupid dick.
Sheila
What did he say?
Terrance
You're an asshole Phillip.
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
Laughter. She turns the set off.
Shiela
Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!
Kyle
But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
Sheila with her arms akimbo.
Sheila
Oh really? Is that so?
Cartman's House.
Terrance
Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart.
Phillip
You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.
Fart. Laughter.
Terrance
Oh no.
Laughter.
Cartman
Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
Liane
Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth.
Cartman
That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
Liane
Ohhh, okay hon.
Stan's House. Stan is going to bed, but before entering he reviews his chores for the morrow. Grandpa has added one more...
Stan
I'm not going to kill you grandpa!
Grandpa
Ingrate!
Stan
Good night grandpa.
Grandpa
You pompous son of a whore!
Mr. Garrison's Class.
Student
Huh huh, I had another ...
Cartman punches Kyle on the shoulder.
Kyle
Ow! What the hell was that for?!
Cartman
That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
Clyde
Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?
Kyle
Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
Cartman
Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
Mr. Garrison
Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
Cartman
[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
Mr. Garrison
She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.
Class
Yeahh, woohoo!
Mr. Hat
Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.
Silence.
Mr. Garrison
You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.
Kenny walks in.
Mr. Garrison
Kenny, why are you late to class?
Kenny hands Mr. Garrison a note. The note reads 'Please excuse me from being late, I have a case of explosive Diarrhea, signed -K'
Mr. Garrison
Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.
Addressing the class.
Mr. Garrison
Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...
Kenny is waving his hand frantically.
Mr. Garrison
Yes Kenny, what is it?
Kenny
(I have to go pee.)
Mr. Garrison
I thought you just came from the bathroom.
Kenny
(I did, I gotta go again...)
Mr. Garrison
Okay okay, go ahead.
Kenny goes in the restroom.
Mr. Garrison
As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment.
Throughout the lecture, sounds of some serious diarrhea come from the bathroom. The sounds get progressively worse as Kenny moans loudly. Kenny reenters the classroom at the end of the lecture. Kenny sits back at his desk and Stan, reacting to the diarrhea's smell, waves his hand in front of his face.
Stan
Whoa! Smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
Mr. Garrison
Pay attention children!
Pounds on the lectern.
Mr. Garrison
I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever.
Cartman
What?
Clyde
Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
Kyle's face drops.
Mr. Garrison
That's right children. Are there any questions?
Stan raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Stanley?
Stan
Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
After a moment of reflection.
Mr. Garrison
What, what do you mean?
Stan
My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
Kyle
Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna.
Stan
Really??
Kyle
Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
Stan
Wow!
Cartman
Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!
Stan
So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?
Mr. Garrison
Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
Kenny
(OH MY GOD!)
Kenny runs into the bathroom and releases a large splatter of diarrhea.
Kenny
(Owww!) [Splatterrrrr!]
School Cafeteria.
Cartman
Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
He starts convulsing and making seizure related sounds.
Stan
Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
Kyle
But won't your grandpa be there?
Stan
Yeah...
Cartman
Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
Chef
Hello there children.
Stan
Hey Chef.
Chef
How's it goin'?
Stan
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Stan
Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?
Chef
You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on.
Stan
No, I mean, kill my grandpa.
Chef
No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal.
Stan
See, I told you dude.
Kyle
Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
Cartman
Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
Stops himself twice before responding
Chef
I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
Stan
What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
South Park PTA Meeting.
Sheila
And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
She puts the tape in and starts the VCR.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, guess what?
Phillip
What?
Rips a fart.
Terrance
Fart.
Sheila
Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny.
Randy
Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh.
Other PTA members stare at Randy in shock. He looks around chagrined.
Sheila
Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
Loud, juicy fart comes from the little boys room. Mr. Garrison exits.
Mr. Garrison
Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.
Amid peals of laughter.
Townsman
Ha ha, green apple splatters.
Stan's House.
Grandpa
Uhhhh.
Stan
Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
Grandpa
Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet.
Stan
No grandpa, I'll get in trouble.
Grandpa
Kill me, God dammit!
Stan
No, I can't even kill a deer.
Grandpa
Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?
Cartman
I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
Seizing the opportunity.
Grandpa
Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch.
Cartman
What!
Grandpa
That's right.
Stan
Grandpa!
Grandpa
And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too.
Cartman
Hey!
Grandpa
Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma.
Cartman
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
Grandpa
That's the spirit Tubby.
Restraining Cartman.
Stan
Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
Cartman
Don't talk about my mom like that!
Dragging Cartman away.
Stan
We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
Grandpa
I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?
Cartman
Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
Stan
Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes.
Cartman
Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
Stan
I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die.
Kyle
I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
Stan
Hey, yeah!
Stan's House, kitchen.
TV Announcer
And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access.
Jesus
Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace.
Jesus presses a button on the phone.
Jesus
First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'.
There's an echo.
Caller
Yeah, is this Jesus?
Jesus
Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback.
Caller
Oh, sorry.
Caller fixes the echo.
Caller
Uh, this is Martin...
Jesus
Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know.
Martin
How the hell'd you know that?
Jesus
Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?
Martin
Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-
Jesus
Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance.
Martin
Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus.
Jesus presses a button on the phone.
Jesus
Next caller, you're on the air.
Stan
Jesus?
Jesus
Yes my son?
Stan
Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
Jesus
My son...
Stan
Yes?
Jesus
I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
He presses a button on the phone.
Jesus
Next caller.
Stan
Goddammit!
Jesus
I heard that.
Stan
What the hell is wrong with everybody?
Cartman
Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
Kyle
Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?
Stan
Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!
Cartman
Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
Kyle
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Cartman
Oh, biiitch.
Turns around and hoists his ass up to simulate a woman with a big ass.
Cartman
Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
TV Announcer
And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans.
Phillip
Oho yeah, I love beans.
Cartman
Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
Grandpa
Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?
Stan
Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart.
Phillip
Well, don't fart on me Terrance.
Cartman
Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
Kenny
(Oh my God!)
Kenny runs to the bathroom.
Cartman
Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
After receiving the dreaded fart.
Phillip
You're such an asshole, Terrance.
Terrance
Haha, that I am!
Laughter.
Disgusting diarrhea sounds.
Kenny
(Ow!)
Cartman
Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
Shelly
Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
Stan
We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
Shelly
No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!
Stan traces the rope and realizes that Grandpa has hung himself, but hasn't died.
Grandpa
Tug - a - little harder, Billy.
Stan
Aaah!!
Releases the rope. Grandpa falls to the ground, landing on his side.
Grandpa
Uh, ow.
Shelly
You little jerk!
Slugs Stan in the face
Shelly
You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!
Grandpa
Dammit! I was so close.
Some time later the kids are the ones on television.
TV Announcer
Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather.
Talk Show Host
Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?
Stan
We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
Talk Show Host
Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame.
In front of Tom's Rhinoplasty.
Sheila
These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!
Crowd
Woooo!
Townsman
Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
Runs into a Port-a-Potty for some quick relief.
Sheila
We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!
Sound of a deep, wet, sonorous fart.
In front of Cartoon Central.
Cartoon faces of Tragedy and Comedy adorn the signs.
Sheila
We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!
Loud cheering from the crowd.
Sheila
We want more quality television, like Full House.
More cheering.
In line to use the Port-a-Potty.
Randy
Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me.
The Mayor exits the Port-a-Potty.
Randy
Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Mayor McDaniels
I just had a brown baby boy.
Laughter.
Stan's House, in disarray. Kyle is jumping on the sofa, Stan and Cartman are tossing the football, and Kenny is flying a kite.
Stan
Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around.
The others scramble to the sofa and start jumping.
Kyle
Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
All
Whoopeee!
Grandpa
Come here Billy, I want to show you something.
Stan
Aww, do I have to?
Grandpa
Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me...
Stan jumps off and follows Grandpa towards his room.
Grandpa
...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa.
They both enter, Grandpa shuts the door.
Stan
Hey, what are you doing?!
Grandpa loads a cassette into a tape player.
Outside the room with Kenny and Cartman
Kyle
What are they doing in there?
Cartman
I don't know.
Grandpa
Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?
Stan
Uh, I guess.
Grandpa starts the tape, which plays a bit of Muzak that evokes Enya's 'Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)'
Stan
Okay, you, you can let me out now.
Grandpa
Not just yet.
He turns up the volume.
Stan
Let me out grandpa!
Stan tries to open the door.
Stan
I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time.
Singer
Grandpa
That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa.
Stan falls out of the room, looking very haggard.
Singer
'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'

Grandpa turns off the radio and follows.
Stan
Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand.
Grandpa
So now will you kill me Billy?
Stan
Sure I will grandpa, I will.
In front of Cartoon Central, New York.
Liane
Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working.
Sheila
It'll work, it has to.
Townsman
Look! It's the president of the network.
John Warzog
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network.
He clears his throat a couple of times.
John Warzog
Fuck you.
A slight pause.
John Warzog
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there.
He turns back towards the building.
Sheila
Hey, you will not get away with this!
He moons the crowd. They gasp in shock. He goes inside and shuts the door.
Sheila
That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'.
Liane
Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?
Sheila
Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?
Liane
[Lustily.] Ohhh, yes, indeedy.
They laugh.
Outside of Stan's house.
Stan
Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up?
Kyle
Yep, all done.
Stan
'Kay, come on guys.
The boys struggle to lift the cow over grandpa's head.
Cartman
Why don't we just shoot him?
Stan
You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
Kyle
Yeah, stupid!
Grandpa
That's good Billy, a little higher now.
Cow
Moooo!
In front of Cartoon Central.
Sheila
The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?
Mr. McCormick positions himself in front of a large sling shot.
Sheila
Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!
Mr. McCormick is flung into the front of the Cartoon Central building, splattering into bloody death. The crowd gasps.
Sheila
We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes.
Sounds of abdominal pain as people line up to the Porto-potties.
Outside of Stan's house somewhere.
Stan
Are you ready grandpa?
Grandpa
Does the pope crap in the woods?
Officer Barbrady drives up. He is staring at the scene of a cow dangling above Grandpa by a rope. Stan stands off to the side, knife in hand, ready to cut the rope.
Police Radio
7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52.
Cow
Mooo!
Officer Barbrady
Carry on.
He starts the car back up and drives away.
Stan
Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you.
Grandpa
Uhh, cut the damn rope already!
Sounds of thunder. Lightning flashes. Death appears and disappears.
Stan
What is that?!
Kyle
Well, it, it looks like...
All
Death!
Death
Mrrrrr!
He points at them.
Grandpa
It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
Death approaches grandpa.
Grandpa
Come on, let's go.
Death continues past grandpa, towards the kids.
Grandpa
What the...?
Stan
Hey, he's coming towards us.
Kyle
Why is Death coming after us?
Death
Mrrr.
Kids
Ahhh!
The kids run into Stan's house and towards his room, Death in hot pursuit. Stan struggles to open the door.
Cartman
Aaaah, runrunruuun!
They enter the room. Stan bars the door with his body.
Death
Mrrr.
Death bangs on the door.
Kyle
What are we gonna do?
Death
Mooorrrr!
In front of Cartoon Central.
Newscaster
As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors.
Sheila
Here Carol, I think it's your boy.
Sharon
Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?
Stan
Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
Sharon
Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there.
Stan
Yeah, but, mom!
Sharon
Here honey, talk to your father.
Randy
Did you turn the heat down?
Stan
Dad, Death is coming!
Randy
Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather.
He hangs up.
Stan's room. Death is trying to enter.
Death
Mrrrr!
Stan
Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place.
Kyle
Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
Kenny
(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
Kyle
Totally dude.
Stan
Good point man.
Death
Mrrrr!
Death cuts through the door with his scythe.
Stan
Ahhhh!
Kyle
Quick, jump through the window.
Cartman
Ehh, eh, ehhhh!
Kenny pushes Cartman out the window and follows.
Death
Mrrrr!
South Park Main Street.
Kids
Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!
Death is following the kids on a tricycle. Grandpa tries to keep up on his electric wheelchair.
Grandpa
Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
Kids
Aaaah!
Kyle sees Death close to Kenny.
Kyle
Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
Grandpa
Come over here you son of a whore!
Death ignores him, but something in T.V. World makes Death take a second look. Terrance and Phillip are on TV floating in spacesuits. There are seven screens - a giant central one flanked by three smaller ones on each side.
Phillip
Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?
Terrance
Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?
Farts. Canned laughter.
Phillip
Oh, you farted.
Death laughs.
Terrance
Ohho God.
Death is laughing uncontrollably.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?
Phillip
No Terrance, why don't you tell me?
Terrance
Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!
Laughter. Death laughs.
Stan
[Noticing.] Hey look!
After Terrance farts.
Phillip
Oh, there's one.
The kids go back to watch the show with Death. They are all laughing.
In front of Cartoon Central.
Newscaster
Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is...
He puts his hand to his earphone.
Newscaster
Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!
The door to Cartoon Central opens. The president emerges wearing a gas-mask.
Townsman
Wait, wait.
John Warzog
Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked.
Shot of a large pile of crap lying in front of the two Porto-potties.
John Warzog
Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers.
The crowd cheers.
John Warzog
Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!
The crowd continues to cheer.
Townsman
Huh, oh no!
He is launched, and he leaves a bloody mess on the sign.
Sheila
At last, now we can return to normality.
Television store in downtown South Park.
Terrance
Hey Phillip.
Phillip
Yes Terrance?
Terrance
Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
Phillip
Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check.
Cartman
Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on.
Static appears on the TV, and then a new screen comes up.
TV Announcer
We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
Loud Static. Death is upset and resumes his mission.
Death
Mrrrrr!
Kids
Ahhh!
South Park Main Street. Death turns and touches Kenny, and Kenny falls over, dead.
Kyle
Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
Stan
Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time.
Grandpa
Hey, you were supposed to kill me!
Death
Mrrr.
Grandpa
That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it.
Death points a cold finger up the street. From a misty haze emerges an incredibly haggard looking ghost of a man.
Stan
Whoa!
Great-Great-Grandpa
Billllyyyy...
Grandpa
Grandpa?
Great-Great-Grandpa
That's right, Billy.
Grandpa
My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?
Great-Great-Grandpa
I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo.
Grandpa
Limbo?
Great-Great-Grandpa
I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes.
Grandpa
But I've been waiting for 25 years.
Great-Great-Grandpa
Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes...
Death, Great-great-grandpa and Kenny's ghost fade away into the mist.
Stan
Come on you guys, let's go home.
A rat comes up and takes Kenny's corpse away.
Stan's House.
Sheila
Here they are!
Randy
Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
Stan
What do you mean?
Sharon
We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
Cartman
You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
Sheila
But look what they put on.
Turns on the TV.
TV Announcer
And now back to She's the Sheriff.
Cartman
Ohhh, God, No!
Suzanne Somers
You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
Dude
Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it.
Sheila
What did he say?
Suzanne
Up yours, butt-munch.
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
She turns on her heel and takes up her sign.
Sheila
Come on everybody, back to New York!
The Marshes follow her out the door.
Kyle
Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?
Stan
I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
Cartman
My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
Kyle
Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?
Stan
Cool!
Cartman
Yeah!
Grandpa wheels up wearing a touristy shirt, carrying an Africa brochure.
Stan
What are you doing grandpa?
Grandpa
I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
Stan
That's my silly grandpa.
All laugh. Kyle farts.

Bus Stop. The boys await the bus. Mir crashes. One end of it falls on top of Kenny, narrowly missing the other boys.
Stan
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Cartman
What the hell is that thing?
Kyle
It looks like a UFO.
Cartman
There's no such thing as UFOs.
Sirens wail as ambulance pulls up. Two paramedics go over to Kenny's corpse.
Paramedic
Let's get 'im to the morgue.
They put his corpse in a body bag, then toss the bag into the ambulence and drive off.
Cartman
Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
Kyle
Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
Stan
Hey man, we gotta get home and get our costumes ready.
They walk off.
South Park Morgue. Outside, an owl hoots, then a crow reaches the morgue's sign and shits on it. Inside the morgue a mortician places a hose into Kenny, blood starts flowing out.
Mortician
You know, I think death is least funny when it happens to a child.
Marty places a hose into Kenny, green embalming fluid flows in.
Marty
Oh, yes, I know what you mean.
Marty pulls out a hot dog, pours Worcestershire sauce on it, and takes a bite.
Mortician
Marty, do you have to put that stuff on everything?
Marty
I don't know, it ju- it just makes everything taste so...English.
Mortician
Well, let's let him drain.
They walk away. Worcestershire sauce falls over and pours into embalming fluid. Kenny's eyes open, and he gets up.
Mortician
...So then the necrophiliac says, "If this ain't a cadaver then I-"
Kenny busts through a door and takes a bite out of the mortician's head.
Mortician
Hey!
Kenny bites Marty's shoulder.
Marty
Aaah!
Kenny walks away.
Marty
God damn! That little turd bit me!
Mortician
Me too!
Kenny leaves the morgue and an owl hoots.
Bus Stop. Kyle is standing there with a Chewbacca mask on. Stan walks up; his costume consists of red yarn hair and big rosy cheeks.
Kyle
Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
Stan
Shut up Kyle!
Kyle
What uh, what are you supposed to be?
Stan
I'm Raggedy Andy.
Kyle
Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
Stan
Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
Kyle
No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
Stan
Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
Kyle
Wow! Cool!
Cartman walks up.
Cartman
Hey, dudes.
Kyle
Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
Cartman
It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
Stan
Where'd you get that?
Cartman
My mom made it, isn't it cool?
Kyle
No it's not cool!
Cartman
What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
Stan
No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fat-ass!
Cartman
Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool.
He and Kyle laugh.
Kyle
Hehe. Sissy.
Stan
I'll kick your ass, Kyle!
Cartman
Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off!
Kenny's corpse approaches.
Stan
Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
Kyle
You forgot to wear a costume Kenny.
Stan
Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
Kyle
Yeah, why's your family so poor Kenny?
Cartman
Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.
Stan laughs. Kenny does nothing while birds chirp.
Cartman
I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!
Silence.
Cartman
I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!
Silence.
Cartman
Poor piece of crap.
Ms. Crabtree's bus pulls up.
Ms. Crabtree
COME ON, WE'RE RUNNING LATE!
Stan
Aah, we're always running late you ugly stank.
Ms. Crabtree
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
Stan
I said, "I can't wait to own a fishing tank."
Ms. Crabtree
Oh, neither can I.}
South Park Clinic. Marty and the mortician are being treated.
Doctor
[á la James Stewart] Very interesting.
Mortician
What, what is it doc?
Doctor
Well, your- your temperature is only 55 degrees, you have no pulse, no heartbeat, and your, your eyes are all puffy and sticky.
Mortician
Oh no, you mean...
Doctor
Yeah, I'm afraid the two of you have - Pink Eye.
Marty and the mortician gasp.
Doctor
I'd give you topical medicine, but I don't wanna touch ya.
Marty
Oh I'm so hungry, and all I can think about eating is, eh, brains!
Doctor
Yeah, well for God sake don't touch your eyes. I'll prescribe some antibiotics.
South Park Elementary. The boys are walking into class.
Kyle
Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous...
The entire class has a Chewbacca mask on.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Kyle
Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
Mr. Garrison is in drag, Mr. Hat has a Chewbacca mask on.
Mr. Garrison
It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
Mr. Hat
Roar.
Kyle throws off his mask.
Kyle
Dammit!
Stan
Wendy?
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
Wendy
Yeahhh?
Stan
We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
Wendy
I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
Stan
You what?!
Wendy
I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca.
Stan bangs his head against a desk.
Bill
Heheh. Heheh.
Fosse
Hey Stan, you look almost pretty enough to kiss.
Bill
Yeah, you want to be my girlfriend? Huhuh.
Stan bangs his head again.
Fosse
Yehaha.
Bill
Huhuh.
Cartman
There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
Kyle
Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
Cartman
You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
Kyle
Wookies don't live on Endor!
Cartman
[In a mocking voice.] Wookies don't live on Endor.
Kyle
Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman
What?! What did you say?
Mr. Garrison
Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats. Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel-
Kenny's arm falls off and Mr. Garrison stops.
Wendy looks down at it.
Wendy
Eww.
Mr. Garrison
Is there a problem Kenny?
Silence.
Mr. Garrison
Let's try to keep our hands and arms to ourselves, okay?
Kyle
I'm never gonna win that two tons of candy looking like everybody else!
In front of Cartman's House. Liane is decorating the house and yard, and she sings...
Liane
Oooh, I'm gonna decorate the house for Halloween,
with scary ghosts and bats and creepy crawly things...

She places a poster of Richard Nixon (aka Tricky Dick) on the door. Two zombies, formerly the mortician and Marty, pass by.
Liane
Hello there!
Zombie
Uuuhh.
Liane
Happy Halloween!
Zombie Mortician
Must eat brains.
They attack a passer by, eating his brains and tearing his arms off.
Liane
It's the most wonderful time of the year,
do do do do do do do do-

Passer-by
Aaargh!!! Oh my God!!!
The zombies finish him off.
School Cafeteria.
Kyle
I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
Cartman
Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding? [As Kenny.] No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like. [As himself.] Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
Kyle
Aren't you hungry Kenny?
Kenny just sits there.
Stan
He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
Chef
Hello children.
Kyle, Stan
Hey Chef.
Chef notices Cartman's Hitler costume.
Chef
What in the hell are you doing dressed up like that?!
Cartman
Eating Kenny's pudding.
Principal Victoria walks up.
Principal Victoria
Hello there, children. Ooh, love the Elvis costume, Chef.
Chef
Elvis? I'm Evel Knievel. Why the hell would I dress up like Elvis?
Principal Victoria
Well, why the hell would you dress up like Evel Knievel?
She turns to the boys.
Principal Victoria
Anyway, I hope that you kids are-Daagh!
Noticing Cartman's costume.
Principal Victoria
Eric, God bless it, what do you think you're doing?!
Cartman
Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.
As Kenny, poking the side of Kenny's head with a fork for effect.
Cartman
That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
Principal Victoria
Where did you get that costume, young man?!
Cartman
My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
Principal Victoria
Sshh! Oh, God bless America.
She grabs Cartman's shoulder; he starts screaming.
Principal Victoria
You get into my office before anyone else sees you. I have to show you an educational video.
Cartman
Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o.
Principal Victoria drags him from the table. Clyde enters the cafeteria with his lunch, and Kenny...
Clyde
Owww, you bit my arm!
Clyde's arm begins to throb and glow.
Kyle
[Pleased.] Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.
Principal Victoria's office.
Principal Victoria
Watch the video Eric.
She starts up the VCR.
Narrator
Adolph Hitler was a very, very naughty man.
Adolf Hitler
Schnell ach. Lovental bros lieben. Alle Menschen werden Brüder. Doktor Stalin? Alarm! Menchoss? Zellan vei zamboa-
Cartman begins daydreaming of himself as Hitler.
Cartman
Juden est verboten, a den ascriber utz, kapieda hockuh. Juden est verboten, God dammit!
Puffy the Bear
So remember kids, dressing like Hitler in school isn't cool!
Principal Victoria
Now, do you have any questions?
Cartman
[Gleefully.] Could I see that again? That was cool.
Principal Victoria
You must remove that costume, immediately!
Cartman
I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
Principal Victoria
Well, how about we make you a new costume. Let's see now.
She spies a white sheet behind Cartman.
Principal Victoria
Aha, thought of something. How about we make you a nice scary ghost costume?
Cartman
[Whining.] I don't wanna be a stupid scary ghost!
Principal Victoria
Aaand, let me just make a few quickie alterations, and there ya go, young man.
Cartman looks suspiciously like a Ku Klux Klan member.
South Park Street. Pack of zombies walks down the street. A pair of joggers are jogging.
Jogger
Ho, looks like they got a touch of that pink eye that's going around.
The zombies attack the joggers, who scream for their lives.
School gym, the costume contest is about to start.
Cartman
Boo! I'm a ghost.
Stan
Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
Cartman
Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
Chef
Hello, children.
Cartman
Hey Chef.
Chef
Aaaaah!
Chef runs away
Cartman
Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
Stan
Hey, where's Kyle?
Kyle bursts in through the doors.
Kyle
Check this out!
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Cartman
What is that?
Kyle
I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
Mr. Garrison blows a whistle.
Mr. Garrison
Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.
They line up on the stage.
Mr. Garrison
Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers.
Some scattered applause.
Cartman
Who?
Kyle
Dude, I thought she was dead.
Stan
Yeah, me too.
Tina hands Mr. Garrison the results.
Mr. Garrison
Thank you Miss Yothers. Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.
Tina places a second place ribbon on Kenny.
Mr. Garrison
...And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume!
Tina places a first place ribbon on Wendy.
Kyle
What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers!
Tina looks on shocked.
Mr. Garrison
And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children. [Everyone laughs.] Yeah.
Stan
Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
Wendy
Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
Stan
I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.
Bebe begins bobbing for apples.
Mr. Garrison
That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.
Clyde
Brainnns. Ahh.
Clyde attacks Bebe, attempting to eat her brains.
Mr. Garrison
Wait your turn Clyde.
Outside Chef's House. Somebody jumps out from behind a bush.
Johnson
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuhh!
Chef
Ah! Damn Johnson, what the hell's gotten into you?
Johnson
Piiink eyyye.
Chef
Get the hell out of here Johnson! I don't want no god damn pink eye!
Chef closes the door and sits down to watch TV.
News 4 Special Report, referring to Mir's crash landing.
Tom
...And the President responded to the incident by saying, quote, "Screw those Commie bastards, and screw their little wussy space station."
The backdrop shifts to a pair of pink eyes.
Tom
In other news, a pink eye epidemic is now sweeping the town of South Park. Here with a live report is a midget wearing a bikini.
Cut to Midget, behind which zombies are shown ransacking the town.
Midget
Thanks Tom, already more than half the townspeople here in South Park have been infected with the pink eye virus.
Zombies are shown attacking another townsperson, and generally ransacking South Park.
Midget
Symptoms include a complete loss of heart functions, blood pressure, lung activity, and of course, sticky puffy eyes.
Chef
Pink eye my ass. I've seen this kind of thing before.
At the bus stop, nighttime.
Cartman
Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
Stan
I bet I get more candy than you dude.
Cartman
Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
Stan
No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
Cartman
Hey, I'm not the one who walked around all day looking like Pippi Longstocking.
Stan
Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
Cartman
God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
Kyle arrives dressed as a vampire.
Kyle
Hey dudes.
Stan
Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
Cartman
Check.
Stan
Plastic pumpkin pails...
Kyle
Check.
Stan
Taser...
Stan lights it up.
Kyle
What's that?
Stan
For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
Cartman
Yeah, granola pisses me off.
Kenny arrives.
Kyle, Stan
Hey Kenny.
Cartman
Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
Kyle
You still didn't get a costume Kenny?
Silence.
Cartman
Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.
Silence.
Cartman
I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!
Silence.
Cartman
I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
Wendy
Hi guys.
Cartman
Hi Wendy.
Stan
[Pointedly.] How's your barrel full of candy Wendy?
Wendy
Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
Cartman
You what?! Are you insane?!
Wendy
Let's go trick-or-treats.
Stan
I don't think so Wendy, I think you've had enough candy for one day.
Wendy
Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
Cartman
How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
Stan
Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
Wendy
But Stan!
Stan
No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead!
The boys walk away. Wendy looks dejected. A low moan is heard and a shadow overcomes her.
Wendy
AAAAAAAAAAAH!
South Park Clinic. A patient turns to the side and coughs.
Chef
Doctor!
Doctor
Why, hello Chef. Let me guess, pink eye, right?
Chef
No, no doctor, I've seen this type of thing before. This ain't no pink eye, it's the living dead.
Doctor
What the hell are you talking about?
Chef
Think about it: Dead people getting up and walking around, and Tina Yothers comin' to town? Coincidence?? Oooh I don't think so!
Doctor
Chef, Ah- I think maybe the pink eye has made you a little delirious. Le- let me give you some, some topical cream.
Chef
Damn it, don't you see? These people have been thematized. They got no heartbeat, no feeling. I'll show you. Errr!
Chef tears off Mr. Torres' arm. Mr. Torres is gushing blood.
Mr. Torres
Aaah!
Doctor
Uhh, Mr. Torres was here for a routine check-up Chef.
Chef
Oh, sorry.
Chef tries to replace Mr. Torres' arm.
Chef
But my point is, that topical cream ain't gonna fix what's wrong here.
Mr. Torres falls over, in shock from blood loss.
Doctor
Hey hey, now, now, there, there have been a lot of incredible advances in topical creams over the last few years.
Chef
Doctor, who is the first person to come in here with the sickness?
Doctor
Well, uh, i- it was the mortician and his assistant at the morgue, yeah.
Zombies burst through the doctor's door.
Chef
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Chef leaps out the doctor's window as zombies close in on the doctor.
Doctor
Now, now, now let's, let's form a line, I've got enough topical cream for everybody.
They attack.
Doctor
Ahh!
In front of a House. The kids ring the doorbell.
The Boys
Trick-or-treat!
Kenny's other arm falls off.
Elderly Woman
Ohh, how cute.
Reaches to place candy in Cartman's pail. Kenny attacks her arm with a vengeance.
Elderly Woman
Aaah!
Stan
Dude, Kenny!
Elderly Woman
Oh, My God! Call 911, call 911!
She retreats and shuts the door.
Cartman
Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
From inside her home.
Elderly Woman
Call 911!
Stan
Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
Cartman
You owe me a Sweetie Pop, asshole!
City Hall. Chef bursts into the Mayor's office.
Chef
Mayor, we've got a big problem.
There is a pile of money on the Mayor's desk. Barbrady is presently wearing a garter and fishnet stockings. The Mayor stands up, her blouse in disarray.
Mayor McDaniels
Ugh!
Gets up from under her desk.
Mayor McDaniels
Why, why Chef. What a surprise!
Chef lets out a sigh of exasperation.
Officer Barbrady
You're probably wondering why we're standing here with a pile of money and no pants on.
Chef
Actually, uh-
Mayor
Well, I can assure you that it has absolutely nothing to do with the Japanese Mafia.
Officer Barbrady
[Wagging his finger.] Not a thingy-dingy.
Chef
I don't really give a crap! We've got to do something about the living dead!
Mayor McDaniels
You mean, Tina Yothers?
Barbrady and McDaniels chortle.
Chef
No, dammit! I'm talking about the zombies that have taken over South Park!
Officer Barbrady
Well, Evel Knievel, why don't you jump over them with your rocket cycle?
Barbrady and McDaniels laugh.
Chef
[Pissed.] Aw, the hell with you both!
leaves the office.
Mayor McDaniels
Well, let's get back to it.
Officer Barbrady
Righty-o.
The Mayor lies down behind the desk.
Another House, another doorbell. A large individual opens the door.
The Boys
Trick-or-treat.
Dude
Hope you kids like chocolate-peanut butter-cream puffies.
Kenny attacks his shoulder.
Dude
Aaah!
Kenny is literally feasting on this guy. The guy twirls around as he says.
Dude
Get it off! Get it off me!! Gaaah!
He falls down, Kenny takes chunks out of his skull and eats them.
Cartman
Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
Stan
Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
The boys pass by a house being overrun by zombies.
Somebody
Oh, God!
Yet another house, yet another bell. Three KKK guys open the door.
The Boys
Trick-or-treat.
the Klansmen stare back.
Cartman
Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.
One of the guys places a single candy in Cartman's pail.
Cartman
One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
Cartman, Kyle, and Stan walk through downtown South Park. Zombies are tearing up the town. Ned and Jimbo can be seen on a rooftop firing at the zombies. Two zombies are playing hot potato with a head.
Female
Oh my God!
A person off to the left is decapitated.
Female
Oh my God!
A zombie picks up a car and drops it on a child.
Female
Nooo!
Chef's House, and the boys ring his bell.
The Boys
Trick-or-t-Aaah!
Chef appears with two chainsaws in hand.
Chef
Get off my property you brain eatin' zombie bastards!
The Boys
Hey, Chef, trick-
Stan, Kyle
Chef! No!
Chef
[Suddenly calm.] Oh, sorry children. I thought you were one of them.
Cartman
Can we have some candy now please?!
Chef
Damn it boy, what in the hell are you doin' dressed up like that?!
Cartman
I'm trying to trick-or-treat God dammit!
Chef
Remind me to whup your ass good next time I see ya. Now, get in here before those zombies getcha!
The kids enter and sit on his sofa.
Stan
What are you talking about Chef?
Chef
Zombies children. South Park is overrun with the living dead. Haven't you noticed anything strange lately?
Kyle
Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
Chef
Don't you children see, Kenny's turned into a zombie. Along with everyone else in town.
Stan
Oh my God, that means...
Kyle
If everyone is turned into zombies...
Cartman
Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!
Stan and Kyle gasp.
Cartman
Aaah!
Kyle
Chef, you've gotta help us!
Chef
I'm working on it children.
Packs the chainsaw.
Stan
Wait, where are we going?
Chef
The doctor said the first people he treated were the mortician and his assistant. Now, I've gotta hunch we'll get to the bottom of this... at the morgue.
Kyle farts. Stan and Cartman laugh.
Cartman
It was Kyle.
South Park Morgue.
Stan
I don't know about this Chef.
Kyle
Yeah, I'm scared.
Cartman
Remember candy, focus on the candy.
Inside the Morgue.
Stan
What are we doing here Chef?
Chef
Just look for anything suspicious.
Kyle looks around the desk.
Kyle
I found it! I found it!
Stan
What?
holding up an issue of Crack Whore magazine, with Liane Cartman on the cover.
Kyle
See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
Cartman
Eh, shit...
Stan
We told you dude.
Cartman
You guys, shit...
Chef
You better let me take that Kyle.
Chef takes the magazine.
Stan
Hey Chef. Look
Stan and Chef see the embalming fluid, and the knocked over Worcestershire sauce bottle. Chef retrieves the bottle and reads the label, which says:
WARNING!
Not to be used as embalming fluid!

Emergency Hotline
1-800-555-5633
Chef
I gotta call this hotline number children.
Pip bursts through a window.
Pip
Piiink eye!
Cartman
It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
Pip
Aaah!
More zombies are bursting into the Morgue.
Chef
Look out children!
Four zombies break through a wall. One comes out from a file cabinet. One stands in front of the boys and threatens them. Four more come through the wall next to the window, followed by Kenny. Stan pummels the threatening zombie with a baseball bat and takes him out.
Zombie
Ow, ooh, ow, gowuh-
Stan
Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef?
He looks to his right and sees that Chef is now a zombie, dressed like Michael Jackson in the "Thriller" video.
Kyle
Chef!!!
He begins to dance, and the zombies join him. During the song, the zombies are dancing, as though elaborately choreographed.
Chef
I'm gonna make love, even when I'm dead.
My body might get cold, but it's always hot in my bed.
Make looove, don't you be afraid;
Just because my heart ain't beatin', it don't mean you won't get laid.

Wolf howl, then Chef lets loose a howl.
Stan
Let's get out of here!
The boys leave.
Chef opens his jacket.
Chef
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
In the cemetery by the morgue.
Stan
We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
Cartman
Hey, there's a pay phone!
Stan
You call the number Kyle.

Cartman
Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!
He removes the head and arm from one zombie.
Cartman
Aaah, kew!
Stan removes the heads from two zombies at once.
Stan
Sweet!
More zombies surround Stan and Cartman. Zombie Chef is distracted by the issue of Crack Whore Magazine.
Hotline Voice
Worcestershire sauce emergency hotline, this call might be monitored to ensure you the highest quality service, how may I help you?
Kyle
There's a bunch of zombies here!
Hotline Voice
Please hold.
Stan and Cartman are laying into zombies, heads are flying everywhere. Cartman takes one zombie in the groin while Stan is shown removing the head from another. Wendy approaches, Stan turns to see who's next.
Stan
Wendy?
Wendy
Aaahahah!
Cartman
Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
Stan
I know, but uh-... but...
Cartman
Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
Stan
Hey, yeah!
Stan starts revving the chainsaw.
Hotline Voice
For regular sauce, the first thing you need to do is make sure that you do not just go out and start decapitating zombies left and right. Do you understand? Do not start decapitating zombies left and right!
Kyle
Uh, okay. Then what?
Wendy
Aaahh.
Stan
[Apologetically.] Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
Cartman
Kill her Stan!
Hotline Voice
All you have to do is kill the original zombie. The one that started the whole mess. Once you kill the original zombie, all the others zombies will turn back to normal.
Kyle
Original zombie? Well, how the hell do we know who the original zombie is?!
Hotline Voice
We realize you have a choice in worcestershire sauces, we are delighted that...
Kyle hangs up and stops.
Kyle
Wait a minute, that thing landed on Kenny, and they took him to the mortuary.
Wendy
Aaah!
Stan
I, I can't.
Wendy
Aaah!
Kyle runs in with a third chain saw and cuts Kenny in half.
Kyle
Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
Wendy's zombie look fades.
Wendy
Oh, what happened? Stan?
Stan
Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
Kyle
It's working! They're turning back to normal.
Chef
You did it children!
Cartman
Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
Wendy
I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
Stan
That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
Wendy
Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.
Puckers up. Stan freezes up and looks ill, then pukes on Wendy.
Wendy
Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross!
She walks away. Stan just looks on.
Cemetery. The boys are at Kenny's grave. Somber music is playing.
Stan
Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
Kyle
Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
Stan
Dude, you're the one who cut him in half with a chain saw.
Cartman
Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way.
Cartman begins to sob uncontrollably. Kyle tries to console him, but refrains.
Stan
You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
Kyle
...No, dude, that's Christmas.
Stan
Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
Kyle
Costumes and candy.
Stan
Oh.
Cartman still wailing, then abruptly snaps out of it.
Cartman
Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
Kyle
We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
Stan
Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
Cartman
Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
Somber music plays again. Zoom in on Kenny's grave. Weird music plays as Kenny, newly sewn together, bursts from the grave.
Kenny
(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass.)
A statue of an angel falls on Kenny.
Kenny
(Ow!)
A moment later an airplane crashes into Kenny and the statue.
	Cartman's House. The boys are watching television and laughing.
Stan
That was awesome!
Kyle
Yeah!
Liane
Would you boys like some Cheesy Poofs?
Cartman
Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
Liane
Sure hon.
Cartman
And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!
Terrance and Phillip have just landed.
Phillip
Hey Terrance! Looks like this might be a good place to start a new colony.
Terrance
It sure does Phillip. No one will oppress our religion here.
Farts.
Phillip
AAAAAH!
Laughter. The boys are now enjoying their Cheesy Poofs.
Phillip
Aaah! You stained my pilgrim hat butt-pipe!
Cartman
Did you guys see that? That was sweet.
TV Announcer
Coming up next on the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, Phillip farts on Terrance, and laughs.
Kyle
Oh, cool.
TV Announcer
And now a word from our sponsor.
Sally Struthers
Here in the heart of Africa children are dying. Not from disease or war, but from hunger. I'm Sally Struthers. These children are in desperate need, and only you can help.
Stan
Hey, who's that fat chick?
Kyle
Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
Stan
Oh.
Sally Struthers
You see, here, in the middle of Africa, food is extremely scarce.
Stan
Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
Kyle
Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
Cartman
Yeah, HEY!
Sally Struthers
For just five dollars a month you can sponsor a child.
Cartman
That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
Sally Struthers
Sponsor now and we'll also send you this Teiko digital sports watch as a free gift.
Cartman
KICK ASS!!
Stan
SWEET!
Kenny
(Woohoo!)
Stan
I'll call. I know my mom's credit card number.
Stan dials up the number.
Kyle
Did they say if it's waterproof?
Stan
Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?
Listens for the answer.
Stan
Oh.
Kyle
What did she say?
Stan
Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
Kyle
Ass-rammer.
Stan
Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
Cartman
When do we get the sports watch?
Stan
Just a second fat-ass!
Cartman
You vas-deferens!
Stan
Hello? No, no, it's a ma- [To his friends, confused.] Vas-deferens?
Kenny
(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)
Stan
Oh.
Kyle
Ask her if we get the watch right away.
Stan
Do we get the sports watch right away?
Pause.
Stan
She says we do.
All
Cool.
Cartman
I get to wear it first, you guys.
Mr. Garrison's Classroom.
Kyle
I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
Cartman
Yeah, but I get to wear it first, I said.
Mr. Garrison
Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?
Cartman raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Eric?
Cartman
When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
Mr. Garrison
Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Eric listens.
Mr. Garrison
A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
Stan
You mean, like Kenny?
Mr. Garrison
Exactly.
Cartman
Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
Mr. Garrison
[Impatiently.] I don't know Eric, they just do.
Kyle sniffs at Kenny. Kenny withdraws.
Mr. Garrison
Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
Cartman
I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
Wendy
Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
Cartman
Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
Wendy
This is the one time of year you're supposed to care about people who can't eat!
Cartman
Isn't it enough that I pay taxes?! What about the poor houses that, that I pay for?!
Wendy
Many would rather die than go to those places!
Cartman
Well then, perhaps they should, and decrease the surplus population!
Mr. Garrison
Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
That's right, Mr. Garrison, Englebert Humperdink was the first person on the moon, who was the second?
A pack of wild turkeys burst into the classroom.
Clyde
Aaaah!
Mr. Garrison climbs atop his desk.
Mr. Garrison
What the hell is going on?!
The turkeys are tearing up the classroom. One of them rips up a Thanksgiving poster and takes it with him.
Clyde
Aaaah!
A turkey overturns Clyde's desk, dumping Clyde on the ground. Some others vandalize the blackboard. Just as suddenly as they entered, the turkeys exit, closing the door behind them. Silence ensues.
Mr. Garrison
Well, you don't see that everyday.
City Hall.
Mayor McDaniels
Okay. Now, once we have all the canned foods collected we'll need some clever way to distribute them to the poor.
Aide 2
It should be something festive.
Mephesto and Kevin burst into the office.
Mephesto
Mayor, we've got a very big problem.
Mayor McDaniels
Ahh, you're that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill, right?
Mephesto
Yes, and I may have made a horrible mistake. I was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for Thanksgiving.
Mayor McDaniels
[Warily.] Uh huh.
Mephesto
You know, to provide food for the needy.
Mayor McDaniels
[Sarcastically.] Of course.
Aide 1 glances at her.
Mephesto
Well, something went wrong and the turkeys broke free. And the worst part is, they're REALLY pissed off.
Mayor McDaniels twirls her chair around and twirls her finger 'round her ear.
Mayor McDaniels
Naturally.
Her aides snicker, then she turns again.
Mayor McDaniels
Oh, do go on.
Mephesto
We have to stop them or, or they could destroy everything. Time is short.
Mayor McDaniels turns around and pulls out a cuckoo clock, which chimes a couple of times. Her aides snicker. Aide 2 has his ears wiggling. She puts the clock away and the aide stops his ears.
Mayor McDaniels faces Mephesto again.
Mayor McDaniels
You were saying?
Mephesto
They act just like normal turkeys, except they're evil.
Mayor McDaniels
[With feigned shock.] Oh, my!
Turns around and pulls out a donkey, which heehaws a couple of times. Her aides chuckle.
Mephesto having observed how the Mayor was reacting to him.
Mephesto
Somehow I don't think you're taking me seriously.
Mayor McDaniels
Uh now why would you say that?
Cartman's house. The kids burst through the front door.
Everybody
Did it come? Did it come? Is it here yet?
Cartman
I get to use it first you guys! Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
Liane
[Peeks.] Not yet hon.
Stan
Damn.
Kyle
Hey, look you guys.
TV Announcer
And now, back to Part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special.
They are in a snowed-in town.
Terrance
I sure am cold, Phillip.
Phillip
Yes, and hungry too. Being a pilgrim totally sucks ass.
Terrance
Gosh, I hope we don't starve.
Phillip farts a high one and Terrance laughs.
Phillip
Ah, a squeaker!
The boys laugh and then the doorbell rings, and a couple of knocks follow. The boys stand stiff not knowing what to do until...
Kyle bolts to the door.
Kyle
The digital sports watch is here.
The kids open the door smiling in anticipation. An emaciated Ethiopian kid stands looking back at them, with baggage in hand. Their smiles turn into surprises. The postal truck takes off.
Cartman
What the hell?
Stan
Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
Kyle
Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
Stan
Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
Kyle
Maybe they took it literally when we said we wanted to adopt a kid.
The Ethiopian 'speaks' and clicks something.
Kyle
Whoa! That was cool.
Stan
Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
Kyle
What's your name dude?
The Ethiopian Kid clicks something ending with,
Kid
Mabin.
Stan
I think he said his name is Marvin.
Cartman
Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
Kyle steps out with Stan and shakes Marvin's hand.
Kyle
Nice to meet you Starvin' Marvin.
Cartman
Hey mooom?
Liane
Yes hon?
Cartman
We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
Liane
Sure, hon.
Cartman
Sweet.
Cartman steps outside with Kenny.
Stan
Dude, let's bring him to school tomorrow.
Kyle
Come on Starvin' Marvin, I want you to meet my little brother.
Cartman
No no! He's my son! I adopted him.
Stan
It was my mom's credit card.
Kyle
Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
Cartman
Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
Kyle
Totally.
Kenny slugs Cartman.
Cartman
Ahh!
Stark's Pond. A couple is walking near the pond. Romantic music is playing.
Woman
Look how the leaves fall so delicately on the surface of the pond. It's so beautiful.
Man
Not as beautiful as you.
Woman
[Swooning.] Ooooh.
The couple embraces and kisses as a horde of turkeys storm the pond. The guy hears them and looks over her shoulder.
Man
Oh darling, look. Thanksgiving turkeys.
Woman
Oohh, they're so beautiful.
Man
Not as beautiful as you.
Woman
Look at the way they foam at the mouth, like beautiful suds of beer.
Man
Not as beautiful as-
The turkeys attack the couple, stripping their clothes off. Screams are heard as the turkeys overwhelm the couple.
King Jimmy's All You Can Eat Buffet. The price is right. The boys and their families are there with Marvin.
Stan
This is a great way for you to experience America Starvin' Marvin. This is what we call an 'all you can eat buffet.'
Cartman
Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.
The crowd laughs.
Cartman
Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?
A waiter places a plate of shrimp in front of Cartman.
Cartman
You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
Marvin
Ap-ee-tizer.
Cartman
This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.
A waiter approaches with plates of ham, turkey, and drumsticks.
Cartman
Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers.
He tosses the plate of shrimp into a trash can. The shrimp don't make it in. He, Liane, and Stan work on the drumsticks, Randy slices into the turkey, and Kyle is slicing some ham for himself (!). Marvin reaches for a pot-pie on Cartman's plate.
Cartman
No Starvin' Marvin, that's my pot-pie.
Stan
Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
Cartman
Oh yeah, you're right.
eyes a slice of pie sitting before Marvin.
Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man? [Heading to a whisper.] Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
Mr. Garrison's Classroom.
Mr. Garrison
Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.
He reaches into the box of canned goods.
Mr. Garrison
And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?
The class stares back blankly.
Mr. Garrison
Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.
Silence. Mr. Garrison begins laughing.
Mr. Garrison
Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.
Stan
Yeah, yeah, we do!
Cartman
Yeah, that's right.
Kyle
We do!
Mr. Garrison
All right boys, show us what you've brought.
The boys walk to the front of the class with Marvin.
Kyle
This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin.
Marvin looks inside the food box.
Stan
He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin.
Marvin pulls out a can of food.
Cartman takes it away and puts it back.
Cartman
No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.
Marvin takes it back out.
Cartman
No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
Mr. Garrison
Boys, what the hell are you doing?! This is horribly, horribly wrong. How did you get this child?
Stan
He was accidentally delivered to us instead of a sports watch.
Mr. Garrison
The sports watch from the commercial?
Kyle
Yeah, that one.
Bebe
I want a Starvin' Marvin.
Clyde
Me too.
Pip
Yes, I'll pay fifty dollars for one.
Class
Yeah, I want one too, yeah me, me.
Mr. Garrison
Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
Kyle
Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
Principal Victoria's Office.
Principal Victoria
Okay, thank you very much. Yes, you can pick him up tonight. Bye now.
She hangs up the phone and addresses the boys.
Principal Victoria
Now boys, I hope you've learned your lesson.
Stan
No.
Principal Victoria
You can't care for this child!
Kyle
But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
Principal Victoria
Yes, but you don't actually get involved with the child's life. You're supposed to just send money, and once in a while they write you a letter. You see, Marvin didn't grow up in a normal place like South Park.
Stan
So why can't he live here now?
Principal Victoria
Because he can't!
Kyle
Because why?
Principal Victoria
Because eight-year olds can't be parents!
Kyle
Then you take care of him.
Principal Victoria
[on the spot] I can't, I, umm...I'm very busy.
Silence.
Principal Victoria
I send my five dollars a month, see?
Demonstrating her Teiko watch.
Stan
This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
Cartman
Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
Kyle
You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
Cartman
B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
Genetic Engineering Ranch.
Mephesto
I knew that you were the only person who would listen to me Chef.
Chef
Yeah, well, let's get it over with. This place gives me the booboojeebees.
Mephesto
Look here in my microscope; tell me what you see.
Chef
Uhh, I seee...an extreme close up of ...Vanessa Redgrave's private parts.
Mephesto
Oh, whoops.
He quickly switches slides.
Mephesto
Now tell me what you see.
Chef
Well, I'm no biologist, but I'd say it looks like turkey DNA.
Mephesto
Precisely, but look how rapidly it's dividing.
Chef
What does it mean?
Mephesto
Means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate. If we don't destroy them all, they'll take over the town. Maybe the world.
Chef
Oh, fudge!
Chef ponders for a moment.
Chef
Uhh, let me see that Vanessa Redgrave thing again.
Mephesto
Sure.
He switches slides again.
Cartman's house. Marvin is sitting alone on the couch watching TV. Secret service agents enter the house. Outside, a helicopter flies around with its searchlight on.
Agent 1
Hello there little boy, we're looking for a starving African child who was accidentally sent here instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Marvin points towards Cartman's room. The agents go forth.
Cartman
Hey, hey, what's going on?!
The agents have him in a duffle bag and are dragging him out of the house.
Cartman
Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
Returning to Marvin.
Agent 1
Here's your sports watch son, sorry for the mix-up.
Cartman
Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin!
A truck door closes.
Marvin
Sweet.
Outside the Library.
Mayor McDaniels
So how does this thing work?
Aide
Well mayor, it's based on the cash grab, but instead of money, the cans of food are blown around inside the capsule. The POV inside catches as many as he can to feed his family.
Mayor McDaniels
POVVVV?
Aide
Poverty stricken citizen.
Mayor McDaniels
Ohhoho, brilliant.
A horde of turkeys rush the square and attack a fake turkey and a Pilgrim hat.
Mayor McDaniels
Daah!! What the hell is this!!
The turkeys go through the crowd attacking people.
Aide
I don't know mayor, I don't think it's listed on the program.
Mephesto joins them.
Mephesto
They're increasing in number mayor. These are the vicious turkeys I warned you about.
Chef
It's a, Ih-ihit's true mayor! Those turkeys just ripped apart my cafeteria!
A platoon of turkeys march by.
Chef
Whooa! You won't get away with this, you bastards!
Kyle
Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
Mayor McDaniels, alarmed, steps up to the mic.
Mayor McDaniels
OKAY PEOPLE, DON'T PANIC! BRING OUT THE DEFENSE SQUAD!
Jimbo and Ned enter, armed with rifles. They start firing away, and turkeys go down left and right.
Mephesto
We need more than that! They'll only come back in increased numbers!
Cartman's House. Marvin is taking up Cartman's habits. On TV, Terrance and Phillip are reenacting the first Thanksgiving.
Terrance
Hey Phillip, could you pass the beans?
Phillip
Beans? Uh oh, looks like we'll be at war with these Indians soon.
Terrance attempts to squeeze one off.
Terrance
Huh, eh,
Phillip offers to help.
Terrance
wait wait wait.
He tries some more.
Terrance
Eh, eh.
And some more.
Terrance
Here it comes, ehhhh.
A long squeeky fart bursts forth.
Terrance
Daaaah, I crapped in my pants!
Phillip
Aaaah.
Laughter.
Phillip
I think you got some spatter on Chief Running Wolf.
Laughter.
Terrance
I spattered his face!
Laughter.
Phillip
Now he's a smelly Indian.
Laughter.
TV Announcer
We'll be back to part 14 of the Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special, right after this.
Sally Struthers
Hunger is an enemy that we all must fight. These children desperately need your support.
Cartman walking around in the background.
Cartman
Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
Sally Struthers
So please, call and adopt a child today.
Cartman
I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
Liane
You want some more Cheesy Poofs hon?
Marvin
Yeah, I want da Cheesy Poof.
Liane
Okay.
Marvin
Sweet.
Ethiopian Desert. A vulture is flying overhead, awaiting its next meal to die.
Cartman
Eh, This is serious bullshit! There has to be a Happy Burger around here somewhere.
He approaches a group of Ethiopians.
Cartman
Excuse me, I am a lost little boy, could you help me?
They stare back blankly.
Cartman
Well, screw you too!
Suddenly in a swarm of flies.
Cartman
What the?! Who the hell let all these flies in here?! Hasn't anybody ever heard of insect repellent?!
He walks away.
The Library. The B and second R have slipped a bit.
Mayor McDaniels
All right everyone, it's time to give out canned food to the poor, haa.
The crowd cheers.
Stan
Hey, where's Cartman?
Kyle
I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin?
Marvin shrugs.
Mayor McDaniels
Looks like we have the turkey problem under control. It's time to embrace the spirit of giving with the canned food grab.
The crowd cheers.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on, hurry up.
Kenny enters the "Grab-O-Lux"
Mrs. McCormick
Grab a lot son.
Mayor McDaniels
Have a happy Thanksgiving! Let 'er rip!
Air is pumped in to raise the cans, but Kenny goes up as well and floats around. Status indicator flash on and off.
Mayor McDaniels
Cuhome on, grab those cans little boy!
Stan, Kyle
Come on, Kenny!
Stuart waving his beer bottle.
Stuart McCormick
Come on, son!
Mayor McDaniels
Now, let's see all the goodies you're going to take home to your family.
She switches off the Grab-o-lux with the remote control, and Kenny and the cans drop to the floor. He gets up and exits.
Mayor McDaniels
It...looks like he got a... a-a can of- string beans. Hehe.
The crowd cheers, but the sound of turkeys fills the air.
Chef
What the-?!
Stan
Dude, the mutant turkeys are back!
The turkeys charge over a hill.
Officer Barbrady
Okay people, move along, nothing to see here you looky-loos.
Mephesto
I tried to tell you, but you didn't listen.
Chef comes up and addresses the crown.
Chef
Gather around everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm your...
Chef looks down at Mephesto's companion, Kevin. The turkeys continue their attack.
Chef
What the hell are you supposed to be anyway?
Mephesto
That's not important right now.
Chef
No! What the hell is this little thing supposed to be? It doesn't look like anything.
Mayor McDaniels
Chef, the turkeys!
Chef
Oh, All right. Listen up everybody, and listen good. Go to your homes and arm yourselves with whatever you can. We'll meet back here in fifteen minutes. Hurry!
The turkeys continue their attack.
Chef
We are not going to let our Thanksgiving be ruined by a bunch of turkeys.
Ethiopian Desert. Cartman walks slowly.
Cartman
Damn, you guys, seriously, I'm hungry. I have to eat.
He sees a Red Cross van is in the distance. Ethiopians gather round it.
Cartman
Ah, sweet! The Red Cross!
He approaches the van.
Cartman
I'll have fried chicken and a side of mashed potatoes please.
Red Cross Dude
Sorry kid, but we're out of food. We ran out of funding.
The female partner is putting some things away.
Cartman
What?!
Red Cross Dude
We just couldn't get enough sponsors back home, so now we've got to pack it up.
Cartman
But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
Now behind the van ready to leave.
Red Cross Dude
Sorry dude, we just don't have any funds. Here, have a Teiko sports watch.
He tosses Cartman a watch and hops into the van. The van drives off.
Cartman
WEEEEEEAK!!!
In the woods near South Park. The screen is reduced to a wide screen format, so you know a movie reference is coming. The town is assembled for battle as the Mayor speaks.
Mayor McDaniels
People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.
Townsperson 1
There's too many of them.
Mayor McDaniels
Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!
Townsperson 2
We can't stop them.
Chef rides up on a brown steed. His face is painted blue and white. He is wearing Scottish garb, wielding a sword and shield à la Braveheart.
Chef
Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!
Now pumped for battle.
Crowd
Wooo, yeahhh, woo.
On a nearby hill the pack of turkeys is gathered together. One turkey is also painted in blue and white.
Leader Turkey
Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!
The other turkeys gobble like mad, then sally forth. The town residents stand ready for battle as the turkeys descend into the valley.
Kyle
Here you go turkeys!
Kyle moons the turkey forces.
The town force descends, the mayor and an aide stay behind.
Mayor McDaniels
Does my hair look okay?
Ethiopian Desert. The vulture still circles...
Cartman
Can't go on... need... appetizer... eh...
He looks up to the sky for relief.
Cartman
I'm sorry, God, I'm sorry I mocked poor people. I'm sorry I wasn't more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.
He falls forward to the ground. After a few seconds he lifts his head.
Cartman
Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.
He sees something. A lone building stands in the distance. Cartman approaches. A sign reads, "No Admittance".
Cartman
Huh, I wonder what's in here?
Cartman opens the door and faces towers of Cheesy Poofs, Snacky Cakes, Boogie Bars and Veal Roll-Ups. "Alleluyah" is playing. Cartman stands in awe, then is overjoyed.
Cartman
SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!
He rubs up against them lovingly. He sees a large-screen TV and a potted plant, and walks towards them. He then looks to his right and sees Sally Struthers feasting on some cake and two Ethiopians fanning her with palm fronds. She sees him and stops eating. Cartman is mad.
Cartman
Sally Struthers?!
Sally Struthers
Who the hell are you?!
Cartman
Gimme that cake!
Sally Struthers
Nooho, this is my cake!
Cartman
No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!
Sally Struthers
NOO! You can't have any!
Cartman
No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!
After some more whining he opens the door and sees some Ethiopians passing by.
Cartman
You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!
They turn to look at him.
Sally Struthers
Uh oh.
She just can't eat that cake fast enough.
South Park Forest. The battle continues. The turkeys fight valiently, but many are falling. Ike beheads a turkey. Marvin looks on and scratches his head.
Chef
Stay close children.
His shield blocks one turkey as he slays another.
Stan, Kyle, Kenny
Yeaaa!
Turkey's rush Kenny.
Kenny
(O-Oh.)
One turkey manages to extract Kenny's eyeball as the others kill him outright. They speed away with pieces of him.
Stan
Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Jimbo
The last three are getting away, shoot 'em Ned.
Ned picks off the remaining three birds.
Stan
We did it!!
As the town celebrates, some townsfolk are still beating on the birds, one of them with a large mallet.
Mephesto
My God, what have we done?
Chef
We've saved Thanksgiving!
Mephesto
But all those poor turkeys, theh- they're all dead.
Chef
Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.
Mephesto
As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn't be toying with God's creations, perhaps I should-
Chef
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Two secret service agents approach Chef and Barbrady, ignoring the carnage.
Agent 2
Excuse me sir, we're looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch.
Showing a picture of Marvin.
Agent 1
Have you seen anyone fitting this description.
Officer Barbrady
Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.
Marvin approaches the two agents.
Agent 1
There you are. Are you ready to go home now?
Marvin looks at Mr. Garrison, then at Chef, then at Officer Barbrady. He quickly shakes an affirmative. The agents lead him away, but he turns back to get some turkeys. Stan and Kyle look on as Kenny's corpse lies motionless behind them.
Stan
Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
Kyle
Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
Stan
You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.
Kenny's head moves.
Stan
But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
Kyle
Yeah.
A rat moves in and out of Kenny's empty eye socket, then scurries away.
Kyle
And that means that McGyver is a real person too.
Ethiopian Desert. Three Red Cross workers are present.
Red Cross Chick
We're terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We'll get you back home immediately.
Cartman
That's right you will, God-Damnit.
A male agent checks his watch.
Cartman
Move it POVs, I'm an American!
A plane lands. Marvin exits the plane.
Ethiopian
A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga.
Marvin
Baba gook gook ba.
The cargo door lowers in back of the plane and a bunch of dead turkeys fall out. The Ethiopians grab the turkeys and raise Marvin on their shoulders in triumph. They march away, passing by a spit on which Sally Struthers has been tied, with an apple in her mouth.
Sally Struthers
(What are you doing? Let me off of here!)
Kenny's House.
Stuart
Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.
Mrs. McCormick
Amen.
She takes a brief look around.
Mrs. McCormick
Does anybody have a can opener?
Stuart
God Damn-it.
	The kids are gathered on stage at one end of South Park Elementary's gym.
Class
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year!

Stan steps forth from the choir and heads towards center stage.
Stan
Lights, please.
The lights dim. He steps into the spotlight and quotes from the Gospel of Luke (2:8-11,14).
Stan
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields,
keeping watch over their flocks by night.
And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them,
and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them,
'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy,
for born unto you this day in the city of
...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.
Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace,
goodwill towards men'

And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus.
Stan steps aside while presenting the Nativity scene. The curtains open, and nine students stand in and around the grotto. Kenny is the angel floating above the manger, Wendy is Mary, about to give birth; Kyle is Joseph, ready to receive Jesus; Cartman is one of the three shepherds on the left side of the stage, and three Wise Men stand on the right side. Wendy is simulating birth pangs.
Wendy
Unh [labored breathing] Oh!
Kyle
Come on, Mary! Push!
Wendy
Aaaah!
Kyle
I can see its head!
Wendy
UUuuhh-UUuuhh.
A doll pops out beside Mary and flips through the air. Joseph catches it.
Kyle
It's a boy!
Unfortunately, he's now holding the doll wrong.
Cartman
Oohhhh!
Kenny
(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)
Mr. Garrison
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that? You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head. What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Kyle
...Sorry.
Mr. Garrison
And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
Wendy
Okay.
Sheila approaches Mr. Garrison.
Sheila
Mr. Garrison, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Mr. Garrison
Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head.
Mary and Joseph are now looking at them argue.
Sheila
How dare you include the Nativity in a school play? Don't you realize my son is Jewish?!
Kyle drops his head.
Mr. Garrison
...So?
Sheila
So what makes you think he should play Joseph of Arimathea?
Mr. Garrison
Because it's Christmas???
Sheila
Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
All the kids gasp.
Mr. Garrison
Oh god, you're not gonna lay that Hanukkah crap on me, are you?
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?!? You're not going to get away with this, Mr. Garrison!!
Cartman
Oh dude! Kyle's mom is here to ruin Christmas!
Kyle shoots back.
Kyle
Shut up, fat boy!
Cartman
I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
Stan
Why are you Jewish on Christmas, Kyle?
Mr. Garrison
Oh-kay! Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?
Sheila
How about the dreidel song, bubbe?
Kyle
I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
Mr. Garrison
The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-

Stan
Christmas Poo?
Cartman
What the hell is Christmas Poo?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
Sheila
Kyle, that is enough!
Mr. Garrison
See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
Sheila
Now that does it! I'm going straight to the mayor about you, Mr Garrison.
Mr. Garrison interrupts and follows her
Mr. Garrison
Oh wait wait wait. I'm sorry. Was it the pagan remark?
Wendy gets up.
Wendy
You guys, look! It's snowing!
Snow is seen through a window. The kids step out of costume and rush out of school to take advantage of this opportunity, cheering all the way.
In the school playground.
Stan
Whoa, Christmas snow!
Wendy
Try to catch snowflakes on your tongue.
A soft instrumental starts up.
Wendy
It's fun.
The kids shuffle back and forth catching snowflakes. When Kenny looks up an eagle passes overhead and dumps a load - right on Kenny's face.
Cartman is watching with glee.
Kenny
P'tooui.
Stan
That was sick, dude!
Cartman seeing Kyle lolling for a snowflake.
Cartman
Hey!
Kyle is taken aback
Cartman
What the hell are you doing? Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
Kyle
We can, too!
Stan
...Nnnaw I think it's against the law, dude.
Kyle
Officer Barbrady!
Officer Barbrady
What?
A car screeches to a halt as Officer Barbrady raises his arm.
Kyle
Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
After a long pause.
Officer Barbrady
Yyess.
Kyle
Damnit!
Stan
Hey come on guys. We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
Cartman
Yeah. We'll see you later, Kyle. Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
Kyle
No. But I get Hanukkah presents for eight days.
Cartman
Too bad it's usually a dreidel or something lame like that.
Stan
We'll catch up with you later, Kyle.
Stan walks off with Wendy and the others.
Kyle
Wait! I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
Stan
Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Cartman
Uh, Kyle? Come on, seriously? You are really reaching right now.
Kyle
Well! You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
Cartman
You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle.
Cartman and walks away.
Stan
See you around, dude.
Stan follows Cartman away.
Kyle is left alone in the playground as winds howl around him. The camera zooms in on him as the intro to his song plays.
Kyle
It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas...

He walks away, then peeks at the mall from behind a tree. Stan is on Santa's lap while Cartman and Kenny wait in line, now forming on Santa's left.
Kyle
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas.

He walks down the road, past a Toy Shoppe and a stand of Christmas trees. The camera pulls back as he walks out of view.
Outside City Hall a crowd gathers.
Mayor McDaniels
Ahem. Okay everybody, settle down.
Large woman
Mayor, we are deeply offended by the Nativity scene in front of the capital office. Church and State are separate!
Some men
No! Wrong!
Kyle appearing among his friends.
Kyle
What's going on, you guys?
Stan
The whole town's pissed off at each other. It's really sweet.
Sheila
That isn't all, Mayor! The school play is doing a Nativity scene! It isn't being sensitive to the Jewish community!
Mr. Garrison
You are the Jewish community!
Crowd
Yeah! Yeah!
Cartman
Oh, boy! Super-bitch is at it again!
Kyle
Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Father Maxi
Mayor, the Nativity is what Christmas is all about. If you remove Christ, you must remove Santa and Frosty and all of that garbage, too!
The crowd cheers in agreement.
Woman
Hallelujah!
Man
Amen!
Tree hugger
And we must put a stop to the cutting down of Christmas trees!
Man 1
Raah!
Man 2
Give me a break!
Uncle Jimbo
And I'm sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids. If you don't want to spill your coffee, you shouldn't be driving with it.
The crowd processes Jimbo's words.
Crowd
Yeah! Yeah!
Mayor McDaniels
Okay, people, we clearly need to reach a compromise. Perhaps we need a new icon for Christmas.
Assistant 1
Oooo, brilliant idea, Mayor!
The crowd mulls over the suggestion.
Kyle
Hey! How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
Mayor McDaniels
Ex-cuse me?
Kyle
Mr. Hankey. He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
Sheila
Kyle! Sshhh!
Kyle
It's true. He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-

Cartman
[stopping Kyle] Never mind him. He's a very disturbed little boy.
Kenny
(Kyle's crazy!)
Stan
Yeah.
Sheila
Okay, Kyle, we're leaving right nowww.
Sheila drags him away.
Kyle
Wait...
Mayor McDaniels
Anyway, I'll put together a crack team of my best workers to make sure this'll be the most non-offensive Christmas ever - to any religious or minority group of any kind. Are there any other suggestions?
Mr. Garrison raises his hand.
Mayor McDaniels
Yes, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Can we get rid of all the Mexicans?
Looks back, then.
Mayor McDaniels
No, Mr. Garrison, we cannot get rid of all the Mexicans.
Mr. Garrison
Rats!
Kyle's house, the living room. Ike opens up his present - a dreidel. He gives it a spin. The camera pans to the right and stops at Kyle and his dad.
Gerald Broflovski
It is sick and disgusting, and we simply will not have it!
Sheila pops out from behind Gerald.
Sheila
Your father's right, Kyle.
Gerald
Sheila, let me handle this. Having imaginary friends is fine, Kyle, but this simply will not do!
Sheila pops out again.
Sheila
Listen to your father, Kyle.
The dreidel has gone off to the right, and Ike goes after it, bumping into the coffee table. The Channukah menorah on it (day 6) falls on Ike, and he begins to burn.
Gerald
Now, I want you to repeat after me: 'There is no such thing as Mr. Hankey'.
Kyle
But dad, he always sh...
Gerald
Say it!
Kyle
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Gerald
Again!
Kyle
There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
Sheila pops out again.
Sheila
This is for your own good, bubbe.
Gerald
Now, you go brush your teeth and march into bed! You won't be opening your Channukah present tonight!
Kyle
[softly, under his breath] Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
Gerald
What did you say?!
Kyle enters his room.
Kyle
I said Ike's on fire!
Ike
Oh oh. On flame? Oh oh. On flame?
Sheila
Oh my God!
Gerald quickly smothers Ike with a blanket to douse the flames.
Kyle's house, the bathroom. He is brushing his teeth.
Kyle
It isn't fair! I don't want to be an outcast!
A voice is echoing from the toilet
Voice
Kyle.
Kyle faces the toilet, then returns to brushing his teeth.
Kyle
I'm not hearing that.
Voice
Kyle.
Kyle hops down and goes to the toilet, then looks into it.
Kyle
Mr. Hankey?
Mr. Hankey pops up and makes his entrance wearing white gloves and a red elf cap.
Mr. Hankey
Howwwwdy-hoooo.
Mr. Hankey jumps onto the sink.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, Kyle. Gosh, you're looking swell.
Kyle
[now wary] Go away, Mr. Hankey.
Mr. Hankey
You know something, Kyle? You smell an awful lot like flowers.
Kyle
I said go away! My father said you aren't real.
Mr. Hankey
Not real? Well shucks. If I weren't real, could I sing this jolly Christmas song?
He begins to sing. As he does so, he skips around the room and leaves bits of poo behind.
Mr. Hankey
Santa Claus is on his way
He's loaded goodies on his sleigh
To drop them off on Christmas Day
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.

Kyle
Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
Mr. Hankey
Folks'll gather round the fire
sing a song, stroll the choir
Pretty song they'll all retire
And I'll say 'Howdy-ho'.

He leaves 'NOEL' written in poop on the vanity mirror.
Gerald knocks on the door.
Gerald
Kyle, what are you doing in there?
Kyle
Nothing.
He knocks again.
Gerald
Open this door!
Mr. Hankey
I hope that Santa comes real soon
I've been waiting for some we...

Kyle
Mr. Hankey, come here.
Kyle grabs Mr. Hankey and muffles him, and turns as Gerald opens the door. Gerald sees a bathroom smeared with feces everywhere, and a boy facing him holding a big piece of it in his left hand. He gasps and remains speechless.
Gerald
KYLE!
Kyle throttles the poo.
Kyle
Say something, Mr. Hankey!
It falls over, and Kyle looks forsaken.
Kyle's bedroom. Kyle is now in bed.
Gerald
Now, you get to sleep, and think about how your poor mother has to clean that bathroom up!
Sheila
Whatwhatwhaaat?! Me?!
Gerald looks towards his room and quickly closes the door.
Mr. Hankey is now on Kyle's comforter.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho!
Kyle
Mr. Hankey! Where the hell did you go?
Mr. Hankey
You should be wearing socks to sleep, Kyle. You're gonna catch a cold.
Kyle
Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
Mr. Hankey
Aw, gee, that's too bad.
Kyle
Hey! How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
Mr. Hankey
Say, that sounds like a swell idea. We can show everyone the true spirit of Christmas.
Kyle
Yeah! We'll show them!
Kyle smiles, pleased with the idea.
Downtown South Park.
Mayor McDaniels
Okay, people, we've got to turn this place around! Take down anything that is offensive to any specific group!
The crowd sets about dismantling the decorations. A man removes Santa's head from his sleigh and tosses it onto the street.
Uncle Jimbo calls forth from his shop.
Uncle Jimbo
Is mistletoe offensive?
Mayor McDaniels
Is anyone offended by mistletoe?
One man raises his hand.
Mayor McDaniels
Lose the mistletoe!
Jimbo clips it off.
Bus stop.
Stan
You guys! I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
Cartman
How do you know?
Stan
'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
Cartman
Yeah? Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting. The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
Stan
What's that?
Cartman
I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
Kyle arrives.
Kyle
Hello, everybodyyy.
Stan
What's in the box, dude?
Kyle
It's a surprise.
Cartman
Let me see!
The boys gather around the box.
Kyle
O-Okay. But don't scare him...
A shot of what Mr. Hankey sees as Stan pops the lid open, then a top-down view as the poo is shown in all its glory. Cartman and Stan blink.
Stan
[angrily] Dude, sick!!!
Kyle looks down at his poo.
Cartman
Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
Kenny
(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
Kyle
Wait! You guys! He's alive!
Kyle jostles the box.
Stan
Kyle, I think you'd better get home and get some sleep.
Kyle is shaking the box now.
Kyle
Come on, dance! Daaance! Dance, damn you!!
Research Center, a Researcher is shown before at least six subjects.
Researcher
Now this is very simple. I'm going to say words and the computer will measure how offended you are by them. In this way we can find out which words are least offensive for use in the holiday season. Are we ready?
The group looks back at him.
Researcher
Here we go: Christ
Two responses.
Researcher
Hm. Okay. Cherub.
No response.
Researcher
Hm... Camel
One response.
Researcher
Hm. Sad.
No response.
Researcher
Stupid Wop Dago.
All respond.
Researcher
Bench...
South Park Elementary, the school gym. The janitors are clearing out the decorations.
Mr. Garrison
Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
Janitor 2
Mayor's orders.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play. The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
Cartman
Thanks to Kyle's mother.
Kyle
Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Garrison
So does anybody know any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.
Cartman raises his hand.
Mr. Garrison
Yes, Eric?
Cartman
How about we sing "Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch", in D minor.
Kyle
I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
Cartman
O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch,
she's a big fat bitch,
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch,
if there ever was a bitch,
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.

Kyle
Shut up, Cartman!
Mr. Hankey pops to life.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho!
Kyle
[hushed] Mr. Hankey.
Cartman
Monday she's a bitch,
on Tuesday she's a bitch,
on Wednesday to Saturday she's a bitch
Then on Sunday, just to be different,
she's a super King Kamehameha bi-atch!

The class is clapping along gleefully by now, while Kyle looks at Cartman with ire.
Mr. Hankey
Golly, that isn't very nice.
Kyle turns to hear him.
Mr. Hankey
I'd sure like to teach him a lesson.
Mr. Garrison joins in the clapping, but he's off beat.
Cartman
Have you ever met my friend Kyle's mom?
She's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world.
She's a mean ole bitch 'cause she has stupid hair,
she a bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch bitch
she's a stupid bitch!
Kyle's mom's a bitch and she's just a dirty bitch!
KYLE'S MOOOM IS A - BIIIIII-I-I-ITCH - aahh.

Kyle
Mr. Hankey, no!
Mr. Hankey
Mmmrrr-aaarrrggghhh!!!
Mr. Hankey attacks Cartman.
Mr. Garrison
What the...
The poo is now on the floor, and the class gasps.
Cartman
Gross, Kyle!
Mr. Garrison
Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doo-doo at Eric?
Kyle
Uuuuuuhh...
Cartman
YOU SICK BASTARD!
Some snickers are heard.
The counselor's office, the window showing silhouettes of Kyle and Mr. Mackey. Another student waits outside.
Mr. Mackey, Jr.
Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?
Kyle
I don't have a problem.
Mr. Mackey
Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
Kyle
What's that?
Mr. Mackey
Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
Kyle
Mookie-stinks?
Mr. Mackey
Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
Kyle
Wull, not on purpose.
Mr. Mackey
So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all. Do the other kids make fun of ya?
Kyle
Well, sometimes...
Mr. Mackey
And that must make you mad.
Kyle
Well sure.
Mr. Mackey
Mad enough to kill, Kyle???
Mr. Mackey looks at him up close.
Kyle
No, dude!
Mr. Mackey
Oh that's good. You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?
Kyle
But Mr. Hankey seemed so real...
Mr. Mackey
Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have.
Mr. Mackey sips from his coffee cup, Mr. hankey is now bathing in the cup.
Mr. Hankey
Kyle!
Kyle lowers his head.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho.
Kyle is shocked.
Mr. Mackey
Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, m'kay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?
Kyle looks back up in horror at the counselor, who takes another sip of coffee. Kyle closes his eyes in dread anticipation. Mr. Hankey is still bathing in Mr. Mackey's coffee.
Mr. Hankey
Santa's loaded up his sleigh
flying around his merry way...

Mr. Mackey
To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac...
Mr. Mackey notices the poo in his cup and gasps.
Mr. Mackey
Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey!
Kyle's mouth is twisted with chagrin.
South Park Elementary, the school gym. Christmas lights are still hanging and lit.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy...
Students
Hhmm.
Mr. Garrison
...so Kenny, would you please go over and pull the lights cords out of the wall?
a low faucet is dripping next to the outlet, creating a puddle that goes past it. The class looks at the sight, then Kenny goes over...
Mr. Garrison
Careful now, Kenny, those are very, very dangerous.
Kenny tugs at the cords and they come out. He looks at the class, then walks back to his spot.
Mr. Garrison
Okay. Now let's practice our...
Mr. Mackey rushes in, followed by Kyle.
Mr. Mackey
No! Get away from me!
Kyle
Here. Just look more closely at it.
Mr. Mackey
No! Go away! Stan, you need to do something about your friend, m'kay. Get him out of here before he hurts anybody! M'kay?
South Park Mental House.
Stan
Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
Nurse
Reason?
Kyle
I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
Nurse
Any allergies?
Kyle
No.
Nurse
Jacket!
Two burly men come out through the doors on either side of the nurse and wrap Kyle up, then take him inside, chattering all the while.
Cartman
Bye, Kyle! Happy Channukah!
South Park Elementary, the school gym.
Mr. Garrison
Okay, children, does everyone have their leotards on?
They do, and just look back. The camera now looks out to the audience.
Artsy Man
Good, it looks like they have taken the Christmas trees down.
His Date
Yes, and there's nothing Christian, either. This should be great!
Sheila
Oh, this could be such a wonderful Christmas play - I wish our little Kyle was here to see it.
Sheila is now sobbing.
South Park Mental House.
Kyle
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...

South Park Elementary, the school gym. The MC is on stage.
MC
Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday...
Man 1
[pointing] Wait, wait, there's a star above the stage. That's very offensive to non-Christians.
Uncle Jimbo
Oh, come on!
Man 1
Hey! Don't put your beliefs on me, buddy!
Randy Marsh
I agree.
Mr. Garrison peeks through the curtain.
Mr. Garrison
Oh brother.
He steps back.
Mr. Garrison
Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?
Kenny approaches the ladder and starts climbing.
Mr. Garrison
And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.
Kenny looks down at the pool.
Kenny
(Hunh?)
He looks back at Mr. Garrison.
MC
Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to the South Park Elementary Holiday Experience. Before we bring out the kiddies for the play, here's a non-offensive, non-denominational holiday song by the school chef.
Chef
I'm gonna lay you down by the Yule log
I'm gonna love you right
Baby, I'm gonna deck your halls
And silence your nights.

Kenny reaches the star and makes sure he's safe.
Chef
You'll hear the herald angels sing
When I'm sliding off your bra
I just can't wait to jingle your bells
and falala your love...
You can break my heart, and that means...

Stan
I wish Kyle was here. It just doesn't seem right without him.
Chef
...We should make love,

Cartman
Well. Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
Chef
...'Cause if we don't-

Mr. Garrison
Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
The crowd cheers.
MC
Thank you, Chef!
Kenny finally descends with the star.
Kenny
(Phew!)
MC
And now, South Park Elementary presents the happy, non-offensive, non-denominational Christmas Play, with music and lyrics by New York minimalist composer, Philip Glass!
Philip Glass moves into position and start playing his keyboards. The curtains draw back, and the kids look out at the audience. They begin to move around.
Voice-over
As I turn and look into the sun, the rays burn my eyes.
A track saying "Happy Happy Happy, Everybody Happy" is added, along with an arpeggio. Members of the audience look confused.
Voice-over
How like a turtle the sun looks.
Sheila
What the hell is this???
The kids just keep moving and turning.
Sheila
This is horrible!!!
Father Maxi
This is the most God-awful piece of crap I've ever seen!!
Mr. Garrison
You're the ones who made it this way!
Father Maxi
Yeah, it's because the Jews said it couldn't be Christian.
Gerald
It wasn't our idea to take out Santa Claus!
Elderly Tree Hugger
All you bastards ruined Christmas!
The crowd descends into brawling. A person in blue is thrown towards the stage. The Broflovskis trap Father Maxi.
Gerald
Get him in the ribs!
Sheila punches Father Maxi.
Father Maxi
Oof.
Picking up the elderly tree-hugger.
Man in audience
Damn tree-hugger!
Tosses him away.
Stan
This sucks, dude. This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
Wendy
Yeah.
Chef is now on stage behind the children.
Chef
Say, where's Kyle?
Stan
We committed him.
Chef
What? Why?
Cartman
'Cause. He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
Chef
Chirstmas poo? You yuh-you mean Mr. Hankey.
Stan
Huh?! O-oh.
The crowd continues to brawl. Sheila uses a chair on her husband, who quickly falls to the floor. She watches him fall.
A Mr. Hankey Commercial Plays.
Back at the gym. The man in blue is thrown from his post for the third time - an obvious blooper, as the Broflovskis have Father Maxi trapped again.
Stan
This is horrible! Everybody's fighting and my best friend is in an institution, all because we didn't believe in Mr. Hankey!
Chef
Well! You can believe in him now.
A woman backs up across the stage as a man flies towards her. The crowd is more violent now.
Woman
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH.
Stan
I believe.
A piano begins to play softly.
Wendy
I believe in Mr. Hankey.
A shoebox at one side of the stage starts to jump, and the lid pops off. Mr. Hankey jumps up and floats in the air, surrounded by pixie dust.
Mr. Hankey
Hoooowwwwwdy-ho!!!
Everyone on stage gasps.
Mr. Hankey
Howdy, folks. Gosh you sure do smell all nice and flowery.
Cartman, Stan
Whoa!!
Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, Chef!
Chef
Howdy-ho, Mr. Hankey!
Cartman
Okay, that does it! Screw this, I'm goin home!
Moves toward stage left.
Cartman
Talking poo is where I draw the line!
Mr. Hankey
What's all the ruckus?
Chef
I'm glad you're here, Mr. Hankey. The whole town is about to kill each other.
Mr. Hankey
I reckon this could be a job for Mr. Hankey!
He sees the crowd fighting and whistles. They stop and turn to see him.
Mr. Hankey
STOP FIGHTING!!
The Mayor
Oh my God, what the hell is that thing?
Mr. Hankey
Come on, gang, don't fight. You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, "Aw, the heck with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies".
Father Maxi finally gets up from the floor as a single person begins to clap, and the crowd turns to see that the person clapping is Gerald. Then others start clapping and the town begins to cheer. Mr. Hankey is overjoyed at the response.
Stan
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
South Park Mental House. Kyle sits on the floor of a padded room.
Kyle
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...

Mr. Hankey
Howdy-ho, Kyle!!!
Thinking it's a hallucination.
Kyle
Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
Mr. Hankey
I brought some friends with me.
Kyle
Friends?
Kyle gets up and looks lout a small window. He sees all the townsfolk and smiles, relieved.
Townsfolk
Merry Christmas, Kyle Broflovski!!!
Kyle
You mean you can see him? Ah-I'm not crazy?
The nurse releases him and he rushes out the door. Mr. Hankey follows.
Townsfolk
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo...

Mr. Hankey kisses Kyle.
Townsfolk
...he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you...

Mr. Hankey begins tossing presents to everyone.
Townsfolk
...Even if you're a Jew

Mr. Pirrip
Sometimes he's nutty, sometimes he's corny,
he can be brown or greenish-brown
But if you eat fiber on Christmas Eve,
he might come to your town

Townsfolk
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
He loves me. I love you
Heeeeeeee Looooooves Yoooooouu!

Mr. Hankey, during the second chorus.
Mr. Hankey
Well, I've got a loong night ahead of me. Bye-bye and Merry Christmas.
He floats up to meet Santa as he passes by.
Cartman
Good-bye Mr. Hankey! Bring me lots of presents! I always believed in you!
Santa Claus
Howdy-ho ho ho!
Stan
You know, I learned something today. I learned that Jewish people are okay. And that...Hanukkah can be cool, too.
Kyle
Yeah...[concerned] You know, it seems like something's still not right.
The camera pans over to Kenny.
Cartman
Yeah, something feels...unfinished.
Drum roll.
Stan
Wh-what could it be?
The drum roll heads for a climax.
THE END.
Kenny
(Yee he hee!)
End credits roll.
South Park Public Access. A light is on.
Jesus is on the Jesus and Pals set alone.
Jesus
Happy Birthday to me, Happy Birthday to me...

Jesus blows out the candle on his cake and ends up in the dark. He blinks. Credits resume rolling.
	Classroom: Cartman enters humming with a stack of envelopes. He starts handing them out.
Cartman
Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
Kyle
What is this, Cartman?
Cartman
They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
Stan
Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
Cartman
Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...
Kyle
Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
Cartman
That's right.
Stan
Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fat-ass, too.
Cartman
That's ri-aayy.
Pip
Oh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.
Cartman
[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember!
Pip smiles hopefully.
Cartman
I shoved it up my ass!
Pip's hopes are dashed.
Cartman
Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap!
moves on
Cartman
Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...
Mr. Garrison
[excitedly] Children, children! Today is a very special day.
Cartman
No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
Mr. Garrison
I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
Cartman
Eeeeeeh!
Mr. Garrison
Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... [leans down to the new kid, Damien] uh-uh, what's your name again?
Damien Thorn
Damien!
Ominous Voice
Rectus...dominus...

Dark music and changing plays as Damien's eyes show flaming, crackling pupils.
Mr. Garrison
Say 'hi' to Damien! [Silence.] And where are you from, Damien?
Damien
The seventh layer of hell!
Mr. Garrison
Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama.
Damien goes around the teacher's desk and hops up on it, kicking away the apple. Garrison steps aside.
Damien
My arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father!
Ominous Voice
... rectus... cheesy poofs...

Mr. Garrison
Your father?
Damien
The Prince of Darkness!
Mr. Garrison
Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.
Damien hops down and goes to sit next to Cartman.
Mr. Garrison
Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
Cartman
Hey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?
Damien
Here begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...
Cartman
Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus...

Damien turns to Cartman and concentrates. Cartman's desk suddenly turns over and dumps him onto the floor.
Cartman
Byah. Oof!
The desk goes out the window. The class sits up.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Ominous Voice
Sancti...

Kyle
Damn, what a freak!
Cartman
[Getting up off the floor.] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!
Ominous Voice
Cheesy poofs...

Damien
Now feel the wrath - of the fallen angels! The plague of night is upon ye.
Mr. Garrison
Damien, do you need to sit in time out for a few minutes?
Damien blinks.
Cartman
Eheh. [Taunting.] You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
The cafeteria: The boys already have their lunches.
Stan
Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
Kyle
Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
Cartman
Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
Stan
Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
Kyle
Yeah, that's weak!
Cartman
Look, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?
Stan
Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want.
Kyle crumples up the invitation and throws it away.
Cartman
Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mom's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
Stan
Oh great, Green Mega Man it is.
Cartman
Now. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is.
Damien arrives.
Stan
Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
Cartman
Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
Damien
Infidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!
Kyle
You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table!
Damien walks off.
Cartman
Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.
Stan and Kyle laugh, then Cartman laughs. Kenny punches him.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Damian walks over to where Pip is.
Pip
Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.
Damien
Then I will call you Pip.
Pip
Right-o.
Stan
Hey new kid!
Cartman turns around. Kenny is already facing him.
Stan
Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.
Kenny
(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
Damien
That does it! Woo-paah.
Points his index fingers at Kenny.
Ominous Voice
... rectus... dominus...

Kenny trembles for a moment, and then a moment of silence.
Stan
What the... ?
Kyle
Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
Stan
A what?
Kenny
Quack-quack.
Cartman
Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butt-hole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
Chef comes up behind them.
Chef
Hello there, children.
Stan
Hey, Chef.
Chef
How's it going?
Kyle
Bad.
Chef
Why bad?
Kyle
Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
Chef
Oh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song,
We're all special in our own way
everybody's different, but that's okay,
'cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin,
different points of view, be tall or thin,
it doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin,

A psychedelic scene appears behind him.
Chef
With my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been,

He stands behind a lovely black woman wearing trunks and a big smile.
Chef
Rub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...

He floats on a cloud with a lovely white woman, then he's back in the cafeteria
Chef
What were we talking about again?
Kyle
The new kid.
Damian is standing on a table.
Damien
Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all!
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs...

Pip's cap flies off, followed by milk and lunch trays, large tote bags, wall poster, clocks...
Stan
Whoa!
Chef
Oh! That is one fudged-up little cracker!
...Footballs, bunnyfish, desks, telephones, fire alarms, rifles...
Kyle
We told you, dude.
Kids scream. Pip is awestruck. Kids and lunch tables begin to rise and fly around.
Chef
We've got to do something, children!
Mr. Hankey flies by, then Kevin Stoley, then a cow. (think Twister)
Damien
Bring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus!
Ominous Voice
... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus...

Stan, Kyle
Jesus?
The set of Jesus and Pals. Jesus freshens up, and Roland the cameraman comes in
Roland
Two minutes to air, Jesus.
Jesus
Thanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. [Stan and Kyle dash in.]
Stan
Jesus, Jesus!
Jesus
Ah-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.
Stan
No no. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
Kyle
Yeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.
Kenny
Quack-quack.
Jesus
Wow. That's pretty heavy.
Stan
This new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.
Jesus
The Dark Prince?
Stan
Yeah.
Kyle
Yeah.
Jesus
So it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.
Stan
[To Kyle.] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
Jesus
Thou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.
Kyle
... K.
School playground
Groundskeeper
Five minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!
Cartman is heard speaking. Three kids look at him: Wendy, Clyde, and the Boy with the blue cap, who is taking notes. Cartman stands next to an easel, pointing at drawings he made earlier. A boy with a blue hat joins them later
Cartman
Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Chopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money...
A football lands in front of Damien, who sets fire to it. He then points to the slide, which catches fire and sends Red into another student as Bebe looks on.
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus... sancti...

Red
Aaaaa Bebe!
Bebe
Our slide!
Damien
Feel my wrath!
Damien sends a small fireball from his fingertip to the see-saw, setting it aflame and knocking off Kevin Stoley and Token.
Damien torches the hobby elephants. A boy with a brown hat screams as fire is set to the hobby elephant he's playing on.
Pip
[As Damien torches the hobby elephants.] Oho Damien, you shouldn't be so upset, you know. I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.
Damien
I don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan!
He torches the jungle gym. Butters screams as he falls off.
Pip
Believe me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.
Ominous Voice
... Rectus... cheesy poofs...

Jesus
Damien!
Damien
Aaah! Son of Stench! Cursed Ruler of the weak!
Jesus
So it is thou, Son of Lucifer!
Damien
Your time on this earth is short. Soon, my father comes.
Jesus
Let him come then. I shall stop him!
Damien
Behold! He is already upon us! [Clouds begin to conceal the sun.
Kyle
Ohh, dude!
Satan
Hic dominus ampullicus unum sum. Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Another whirlwind comes up.
Jimbo
What the hell's going on here?
A crowd begins to gather.
Father Maxi
Look! It's that guy from the public access show!
Blonde
What's happening?
Chef
Come over here if you're scared, women! I'll protect you!
Garrison leans onto him.
Chef
Not you, dammit!
Satan
Forante onlisam dum sameli etludemus.
Damien
Jesus, my father says... he chooses you! He calls you out! Be here at this time tomorrow! Then the terms will be discussed!
Jesus
Very well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!
Jimbo
Come on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!
The Crowd disperses.
Stan
You're gonna fight Satan?
Jesus
This fight has been ordained since the beginning! My children, this is the most crucial and serious time... of all history.
Commercial
Who will win our souls?
An hourglass spins on a horizontal axis.
Commercial
Our Savior and Lord?
Jesus launches a fireball into the darkness.
Commercial
Or the Prince of Darkness?
A red demon looms over several fleeing people.
Commercial
It's the final battle between Good and Evil.
A black figure and a white one bump heads.
Commercial
And it's only on Pay Per View! Jesus Versus Satan! Live, from the South Park Forum on Saturday. Call now to order, only $49.95.
Cartman's house. The boys have just seen the commercial
Cartman
Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
Kenny
Quack-quack.
Stan
[To Kyle.] I don't know what to do, dude. Do we go to the fight, or Cartman's birthday?
Cartman
Cartman's birthday!
Kyle
We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
Cartman
You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
Stan
Well, come on. We have to at least see the weigh-in.
Cartman
Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
Main St. A crowd is gathered for the weigh-in. Jesus waits for him, too
Father Maxi
When is Satan gonna show up?
The boys rush up.
Stan
Did the Devil show up yet?
Jesus
Not yet.
Kyle
Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
Jesus
... What the hell do you mean if I win the fight?
Cartman
Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
Jesus
Oh.
Jimbo
We're all with you, Jesus! We put every dime we have on you beatin' that Dark Prince.
The crowd cheers.
Jesus
Thank you for your faith but, I think perhaps you don't understand the severity of the situation.
Father Maxi
You're gonna kick his ass, Jesus.
More cheering. A pillar of fire appears.
Ominous Vocie
Rectus... dominus...

Jesus
Behold. The Evil One approaches.
Satan
Yeah.
He appears, and the crowd gasps at his size.
Mr. Garrison
Holy poop on a stick!
Satan
Puny Son of Jehovah! Prepare to enter thy House of Pain!
Stan
Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
Jimbo
Now that is a man who has eaten a lot of beef!
Satan
Son of God, I will smash thy face into small little bits!
Jesus
Oh - oh yeah??
Man in crowd
Damn.
Satan
I have such delightful horrors to unleash upon thee.
Jesus
Oh yeah??
A scale is brought in, and Satan is directed to stand on it.
Announcer
Satan weighs in at - 320 lbs, 4 oz.
The crowd gasps. Satan steps off, and Jesus steps on.
Announcer
Jesus Christ weighs in at - 135 lbs., 1 oz.
The crowd lets out a long sigh of disappointment.
Chef
Ooh crap.
Jesus
Aw, come on! I weigh more than that.
Satan
Let the new prince be decided on Saturday. First South Park, then the world.
The clouds gather behind him. He then turns and walks away.
Jimbo
[Holding his ticket up.] Well-uh... I think I'll-uh uuduh-I think I left the oven on.
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.
Father Maxi
Uh-ssee ya - Saturday - Jesus. Good luck.
The crowd breaks up.
The Sports Book $. Two screens are showing horse races
Man 1
Change my bet!
Man 2
I'm betting on the Devil!
Jimbo
I wanna change my bet to Satan.
Ned
Me, too.
Mr. Garrison
Wai-wa I was here first.
South Park Elementary, Mr. Mackey's office. Damien is in
Mr. Mackey
Now, uh, as your counselor, I want you to feel like you can tell me anything. mkay? Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, m'kay?
Damien
Everybody hates me!
Mr. Mackey
Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
Damien
Because I'm the son of the Devil?
Mr. Mackey
Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?
Damien
Because I... burn them and kill them?
Mr. Mackey
Well yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. And no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. You be passive, m'kay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.
The playground. Bebe, Kevin Stoley, Butters, and Clyde surround Pip.
Clyde
I bet I can spit the most on him.
Spits, and it lands on Pip's left shoulder.
Bebe
Oh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair.
Spits, and it lands on his right eye.
Pip
Eho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.
Stan
Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'.
Cartman
[Sees Damien coming.] Oh, here comes the unholy butt-hole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
Damien
I apologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice.
A sequence of blinks hints as to the boys' response. Cartman moves closer to Damien.
Cartman
[Farts and moves away.] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice!
Damien is angry, but restrains himself.
Stan
Phew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.
Kyle
Yeah. We're gonna call you Fart-boy from now on.
Stan
Bubye, Fart-boy.
Kyle
See ya.
Pip
Good day, Damien. How are you?
Damien
Those guys farted on me, and then called me-
Pip
Fartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.
Skeeter's bar; people are having drinks. Chef is at the bar talking to someone. Jesus throws open the doors and enters
Jesus
Ahm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-
Chef
Oh ooh.
A woman at a nearby table whistles the same thing.
Jesus
I have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning.
Two men at the bar look at each other.
Jesus
In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!
Father Maxi
You should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!
Jesus
Your bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!
Father Maxi
Oho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.
Jesus
I implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.
Father Maxi
Jesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!
Mr. Garrison
Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
Jimbo
Yeah.
Father Maxi
Praise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later.
Jesus turns and walks out.
Father Maxi
What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, crazy.
Bill Allen and Fosse McDonald's fathers chortle behind him.
Mr. Allen
He's so gay.
Mr. McDonald
Yeah.
The two men seen earlier toast the comments, and Jesus looks in once more.
Jesus
You're all a bunch of Judases!
Outside the bar. Jesus runs into Stan, Kyle, and Kenny
Stan
Hey, Jesus.
Jesus
What are you doing out so late, kids?
Kyle
We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
Jesus
Oh. Kids, you believe I can beat Satan, right?
Stan
Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
Kyle
Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
Jesus
No, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?
Satan's press conference. At least three television stations (4, 11, and 38) have crews present.
Reporter 1
Satan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?
Satan
I will crush him like a little bug!
Reporter 2
Satan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War?
Satan thinks a moment, then begins to answer, but a hand covers his mouth.
Don King
Let's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.
A training room. Jesus is working on a punching bag while Stan and Kyle look on. Cartman enters.
Cartman
You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
Stan
Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
Jesus
No way, dude!
Chef
[In the ring.] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.
Stan
But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
Kyle
Yeah, you have to hit him.
Jesus
Satan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.
Chef
Okay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?
Jesus
Give it your best sho- [Poof.] Oh! [Falls back to the floor.]
Chef
Oh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!
Jesus
Anybody get the number of that truck? [Drops his head.]
Cartman's birthday party; several balloons are tethered to the banner. Carnival music plays. Two elephants are present, as is the Ferris wheel, all in the backyard.
Liane
Come on, kiddies. Eat more.
Cartman is greeting children as they come in with his presents.
Cartman
Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
Chef
Yup! Here's your present, children.
Hands Cartman his gift.
Chef
Well, uh, nice party. Uh, see ya later.
Kyle
Hey, you just got here, Chef!
Chef
I know, but the fight is starting.
Stan
Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
Liane turns to see what Stan said, and sees Chef.
Liane
Mmmmm.
Chef
Mmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.
On the sidewalk in front of Cartman's house, Damien and Pip sit.
Damien
I guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.
Pip
Yes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.
Damien
The other kids have always hated you?
Pip
Oh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me.
Damien gets an idea.
South Park Forum.
Michael Buffer
In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!
The crowd cheers.
Michael Buffer
And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!
The crowd now cheers for Satan. Jesus turns and glowers at them, and they shrink away.
Michael Buffer
Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!
Referee
Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles.
The bell rings.
Cartman's birthday party. A carny does tricks. Damien enters with Pip in tow.
Cartman
Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
Stan
Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
Kyle
And neither were you, Pip!
Pip
Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-
Damien
Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.
His eyes flare up again.
Ominous Voice
Rectus... dominus...

Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.
Small demons grab Pip.
Ominous Voice
... Sancti... cheesy poofs...

Pip
Aaaa!
He is launched like a rocket.
Pip
Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!
He gives off fireworks.
Kyle
Wow!
Stan
Whoa, that was cool!
The children, Bebe, Wendy, and Clyde among them, look up and are duly impressed. They applaud.
Kyle
Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
Cartman
Yeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]
South Park Forum, round 2. Satan and Jesus meet up. Satan gives Jesus a hard left, throwing him against the ropes. The crowd cheers. Jesus looks back, and they are silent. Jesus turns to fight, but receives a blow in the abdomen, again stumbling to the ropes. Satan gives him a left cross. Satan stands back, and Jesus' halo now flutters all over the place.
Satan
Come on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!
Cartman's birthday party. He is now opening his presents.
Cartman
Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves.] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[She leaves.] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?! [Thumps the table in anger.]
Kyle
It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
Cartman
YOU SON OF A BITCH! [Lunges towards Kyle.]
Kyle
[As he is pinned by Cartman.] Aaaaa!
Cartman
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! [Slapping him around by now.]
Kyle
They were all out of 'em dude!
Cartman
I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
Cartman
Aah! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kyle
[Sobbing.] Aaaaaaaa!
Cartman gets up and moves toward the center of the yard.
Cartman
That's it! Party is over!
The kids look glum.
Cartman
Everybody go home!
He turns the party switch off. Music slows to a stop, everything goes dark, and the banner floats away.
Cartman
GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT!
The kids exit the backyard as Cartman announces that the party is over.
Stan and Kyle stop.
Stan
Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
Cartman
Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!
Throws it at Kyle, who is felled by it. The kids regroup in front of the house.
Damien
Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.
Stan
Aaanh, he does this all the time.
Chef
Come on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!
Pip descends from above.
Pip
Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.
South Park Forum, a later round. Satan gives Jesus a fierce left, launching him into the air and against the ropes again. Jesus comes forward, and Satan gives him a right to the face.
Jesus
Oh!
Backs up helplessly.
Satan
Fight, dammit!
Gives him another right to the face.
Jesus
Oow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh!
Satan throws him against the rope, then gives him another right to the face. Jesus now has a swollen left eye.
Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach Jesus' corner.
Stan
Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [The round ends.] You've got to fight, Jesus.
Jesus
Why? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.
Kyle
Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
Jesus
It doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.
Stan
Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him.] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
Kyle
Uuuuh. Stan?
Stan
Nancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!
Kyle
Stan.
Stan
She wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!
Kyle
Stan!
Stan
[Turning to Kyle.] What?
Kyle
Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
Stan
[Thinks a moment.] ... Really?
Kyle
Yeah, dude!
Stan
Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.
Jesus takes a ladleful of water from a pail next to him.
Stan
You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'.
Jesus
... Who said that?
Stan
You did, Jesus.
Jesus ponders these words as he looks at Satan.
Jesus
You're right, Stan. Thank you, boys!
He gets up as the next round begins and fights without his halo.
Kyle
Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
Stan
Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
Kyle
Hmmm.
Satan takes a couple of swings at Jesus, but Jesus ducks them.
Satan
Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!
Jesus
Okay, pal. You asked for it!
The crowd looks on as Jesus prepares to punch Satan. Jesus delivers the blow, but nothing happens. The sound of escaping air is heard. Stan just buries his head in his hands in disbelief.
Satan protecting his ribs.
Satan
Ooooooh, you got me.
He drops flat on his back.
Referee
One... Two... Three...
Jimbo
No way! He barely touched him!
Referee
... Seven... Eight.
Satan opens his left eye, then closes it again.
Referee
... Nine... Ten. You're out!
The match ends, and Jesus jumps up in victory.
Stan, Kyle
Our Savior!
Michael Buffer
The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!
Satan pops right back up.
Mr. Garrison
Hey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!
Jimbo
Yeah!
Satan
Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?
The crowd wonders.
Satan
Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!
Satan dances out of the ring.
Father Maxi
I don't believe this!
Mr. Garrison
Yeah, what a mean thing to do!
Satan
[Now on the Forum floor.] Farewell, fools!
Jimbo
Man, that guy is a jerk.
Satan dances away and Stan enters the ring.
Stan
[Over the microphone.] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
Mr. Garrison
Boy, did we get screwed.
Chef
Jesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?
Jesus
Aw heck. [Puts his halo back on.] Do I have a choice?
The crowd cheers with relief.
Jimbo
Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus!
Kenny is highlighted.
Jimbo
Ih-it's comin' right for us!
Jimbo pulls out a semi-automatic and fires away at Kenny. Kenny is soon on the floor with his head blown off.
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
Kyle
You bastard!
Damien
Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you.
Rats swarm all over Kenny's head.
Stan
You're leaving already?
Damien
I have to. My dad's always on the move.
The rats leave also.
Stan
Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
Kyle
Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
Stan
Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
Cartman's backyard. He's the only one at the picnic table, and it's still full of food. Cartman looks full, though.
Liane
More pie, hon?
Cartman
Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
South Park Elementary, the classroom.
Wendy
Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day.
Stan
I know.
Wendy
Maybe we should go on a cruise or something.
Some sentimental music plays.
Stan
I can't afford a cruise, dude.
Wendy
I know, but...we can make a little boat out of cardboard and pretend it's a cruise.
Cartman roars with hysterical laughter.
Stan
Shut up, Cartman!
Cartman
[still laughing] That is so-ho lame!
He settles down and wipes away some tears of joy.
Cartman
Oh man, I...
Wendy
-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
Cartman is roaring with laughter once again and falls off his chair.
Cartman
Stop, seriously; you're killing me all the time.
Principal Victoria
[Rushing in.] Children, I have some difficult news for you. Mr. Garrison won't be teaching for a while. He has to have surgery.
The class erupts in cheers.
Principal Victoria
So you're going to have a substitute teacher.
The class sighs.
Principal Victoria
And I want you to show the substitute the same respect you show for Mr. Garrison.
Kyle raises his hand.
Principal Victoria
Yes, little boy?
Kyle
We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
Principal Victoria
...Oh. Anywho, I want you all to meet your new substitute, Ms. Ellen.
She enters and stands before the class.
Ms. Ellen
[Brightly.] Hello, children.
The boys perk up.
Stan, Kyle
Whoa!
Cartman
[Slowly.] Wow, she's pretty.
Kenny
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
Stan
You can say that again.
Kenny
(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
Principal Victoria
Good luck, Ms. Ellen. If they get out of control, just use this tear gas, okay.
Principal Victoria places it next to the apple.
Ms. Ellen
Thank you! I'm sure I'll be fine.
The boys get dreamy and smile big, even Kenny.
Ms. Ellen
Now, children, I know that you must be very upset about your teacher having surgery,
The boys are in love.
Ms. Ellen
...but I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for all of us.
Wendy starts to notice.
Wendy
[Gasps.] Stan? Stan?!
Ms. Ellen
Now, let me try and learn your names by your seating assignments. You arrre Eric...Cartman?
Cartman
[Brightly.] Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Ellen
Okay aaand you must be Stan Marsh.
Stan
Yeu-bluuuch.
Wendy is taken aback. Stan has barfed only for her before.
Ms. Ellen
[A moment later.] Do you need to go to the nurse's office, Stanley?
Cartman
Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
Stan
I'll kick your ass, Cartman!
Wendy is sad.
Ms. Ellen
So you're alright?
Stan
Bluuuch.
Wendy looks forward, wondering why...
Kyle
Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
Tom's Rhinoplasty
Mr. Garrison
Oh, I have to admit I'm still embarrassed about getting a nose job, Tom. I didn't want people at school to know, so I told them I had herpes.
Tom
You shouldn't be embarrassed, Mr. Garrison. People have cosmetic surgery all the time. Before we start, this computer can help you pick what kind of nose you want.
Tom touches the screen, and Mr. Garrison's face pops up, then a side view emerges.
Mr. Garrison
Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
It sure is, Mr. Garrison!
Tom
Now, we could go with something a little smaller, which would make you look like this.
The nose on his image is shrunk.
Mr. Garrison
Hmmm.
Tom
Or we could straighten out the bridge, which would make you look like this.
The nose is straightened.
Mr. Garrison
Oh, that's not bad.
Tom
Of course, we could narrow the bridge, which would make you look more like this.
The nose is narrowed, at which point an image of David Hasselhoff appears. A flourish is added for effect.
Mr. Garrison
WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
Tom
Alright-y then.
Tom resets the program. The computer turns itself off.
Tom
Now I must warn you, Mr. Garrison, that there are risks. You could wind up a hideous, foul shadow of a creature, so terrifyingly ugly that you're forced to live in the sewers, only emerging at nighttime for scraps of food.
Mr. Garrison
I can live with that.
Tom
[Excitedly.] Alrighty then, let's get started!
They go off to the operating room.
The school playground. The kids are at play. The boys stand before the jungle gym.
Cartman
She wasn't looking at you, butt-lord, she was looking at me!
Kyle
Well that goes without saying, fat-ass, how could she help but look at you!
Stan
You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
Cartman
Until you puked on her.
Chef
[Approaching.] Hello there, children! What's all this I'm hearing about a new teacher?
Kyle
Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful!
Wendy looks at him from the swings, then looks down.
Chef
Is she like uh - Vanessa Williams beautiful or-uh Toni Braxton beautiful? Or Pamela Anderson beautiful? ...Or - is she Erin Grey in the second season of Buck Rogers beautiful?
Stan
Yeah, that one!
Chef
Wooof! I've got to meet this woman.
Wendy
[Approaching.] Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?
Stan
No.
Wendy
Well it is!
Chef
That's okay. You know what they say about women with one arm longer than the other...
Kenny
(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)
Chef
Thaat's right!
Wendy
Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?
Chef
That's okay. you know what they say about women with the mole on the back of their necks with hair growing out of it...
Kenny looks up at Chef and simply shrugs.
Wendy
[Panicking a little.] Stan? We're still Valentines, right?
Stan
Sure, Wendy, whatever.
Kyle
Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents
He turns right and starts walking away.
Stan
Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight!
Stan follows him out.
Cartman
I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner, chicks like vacuum cleaners
Cartman's voice trails off as he follows his friends away. Chef leaves as well, Wendy takes a step to go with them, but stops and ponders her relationship with Stan. A tear wells up in her eye, then falls as she sniffs.
Female singer
I remember when we were still in love
The moments that we shared were timeless.
Saw it in the wind, knew it in a glance,
the songs we sang were simple reminders.

(Montage)
[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part I (he throws up every time)]
Stark's Pond: she comes up behind him and says, "Hi, Stan"
Stark's Pond: she asks him to come with her (to get Cartman)
Cafeteria: she hands him a note (an invitation to Stark's Pond)
Cemetery: amid a field of dead zombies, she puckers up
Classroom: she hands him a daisy (he throws up with every step she takes)
Female singer
I can't stop now
[Wendy is still sobbing]
My heart's awake
I feel your arms
My arms to take
I must have changed...

(Montage)
[Moments from Wendy's time with Stan, Part II (he throws up every time)]
A vivid sunset: she snuggles up to him on the limb of a tree
Football practice: she cheers him on, he throws up, she looks away for an instant, and Cartman tackles him.
Cafeteria: he throws up as she approaches; she slips in it and falls flat on her back
Playground: Stan and Kyle are working those hobby elephants furiously when Wendy and Bebe approach (he threw up on her thrice a time)
Woods: Stan and Wendy pucker up to kiss (after they got Ike back)
Female singer
...Even when love is the same.
[Wendy sheds another tear, then turns left and walks away]

Classroom. Ms. Ellen is writing away on the blackboard. The boys are smiling broadly. The camera zooms in on the reason why. Ms. Ellen stops writing, but the boys are still smiling.
Ms. Ellen
Oohhh, goodness. Would anybody mind cleaning my erasers after class?
Cartman
[Eagerly.] Memememememe, me!
Bebe
You guys are so immature! Act like eight-year olds!
Ms. Ellen
Stan, how about you?
Stan
Bluuch! I'd love to.
Wendy turns angry.
Ms. Ellen
Now, children, let's review our multiplication tables.
Cartman raises his hand.
Ms. Ellen
Cartman?
Cartman
What's a multiplication table?
Ms. Ellen
Didn't Mr. Garrison teach multiplication?
The class stares back. Kevin slowly shakes his head.
Ms. Ellen
Well, where did he leave off?
Cartman
We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Grieco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while-
The door opens and Chef appears. The class looks at him.
Chef
Oh, hello.
Ms. Ellen
Can I help you?
Chef
[Eyebrows aflutter.] I'm Chef.
Ms. Ellen
Aand?
Chef
I just uuuh - I stopped by 'cause little Kyle forgot his laundry detergent on the playground.
Kyle
My laundry detergent?
Stan
That's not Kyle's...
Chef
Sshh. Crazy cracker's always leavin' that detergent all over the place.
Drops off a box of "Whitey's Washing Detergent" on Kyle's desk, then walks over to Ms. Ellen.
Chef
What was your name again?
Cartman
Uh-oh. Chef's moving in on Ms. Ellen.
Ms. Ellen
I'mm the substitute.
Chef
Well, I'm sure there's no substitute for you.
Ms. Ellen
That's very nice, Mr. Chef, now, if you're...finished-
Chef (falsetto)
[Music starts and he starts to sway]
Nobody could take your place
No way they could match your face, no
You've got it going on in a way so clear,
I just want to buy you a beer...
Uh maybe tonight, at 7:30 or something I could uh - come by and uh -
Pick you up in my caa-a-aaaa-aa-aa-aa-aaar (No substitute)
No substitute for you (No substitute)
No, baby, there's (No substitute)
For you girl (No substitute) for you now
You know that it's true (No substitute)
There's just, no substitute for
You!

Stan
We've got to learn how to do that, dude!
Kyle
Yup!
Ms. Ellen
That was enthralling, Mr. Chef, but...could I get back to teaching now?
Chef
If we can have dinner tonight.
Ms. Ellen
Fine, Chef. [He grins.] Just let me do my job before I get fired.
Cartman
Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
Ms. Ellen
Wwhat?!
Tom's Rhinoplasty. Mr. Garrison comes to, but his head is still in bandages.
Tom
Mr. Garrison. Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Where-eh, where am I?
Tom
The operation is over, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?
Tom
You look great!
Mr. Garrison
Ah-I feel kinda nauseous.
Tom
Yes? Well, that's to be expected. We did some major reconstruction, sawed through some bone, snapped some cartilage...
Mr. Garrison
Aauugh-huh.
Tom
...all the blood and mucus just the sound of bone and sinew coming apart.
Starts making sound effects of tearing flesh.
Mr. Garrison
UUUUUuuuuuugh
Tom
By the way, did you ever see that movie Contact?
Mr. Garrison pops up and turns to the side of the bed.
Mr. Garrison
Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!
Tom
I'm sorry, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you get some rest.
Mr. Garrison lies down.
Tom
I'll check on you a little later.
Tom walks out.
Mr. Garrison
Wuch, uch. Boy I had to see the entire movie to see the alien and it was her goddamned father!
Classroom. The school bell has rung and the kids are leaving
Ms. Ellen
Okay, kids, remember your homework. We have a lot of catching-up to do.
Cartman
[Enunciating.] Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Kyle
[Looks back.] Stop kissing ass, Cartman!
Cartman
I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut!
The students all exit, except Wendy.
Wendy
Ms. Ellen, can I talk to you?
Ms. Ellen
Of course, Wendy.
Wendy sits next to the teacher's desk.
Wendy
I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.
Ms. Ellen
Ohhh. Well, I've taken a liking to all of you. You're all so young and cute and full of life...
Wendy
Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?
Ms. Ellen
Of course, Wendy.
They reach out towards each other. Wendy angrily flips her off.
Wendy
Don't fuck with me!
Ms. Ellen
[Stunned.] Wha?
Wendy
You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!
Ms. Ellen is shocked. Wendy drops from the chair and leaves.
'[Sweetly.] Bye, Ms. Ellen.
Day two, the classroom.
Ms. Ellen
Well, I certainly want to thank all you lovely children for the presents you got me.
A pile of gifts sits on the teacher's desk. Smiles flash onto the boys' faces. She opens the first gift.
Ms. Ellen
Ohhh. What a delightful scarf. Thank you, Kyle.
He's dancing blissfully in his sea.
Stan
[Feigning clearing his throat.] Pf-looser gift, pf-looser gift.
Ms. Ellen
And here's one from Kenny. [She opens it.] Oh, thank you very much, Kenny, this is a very scrumptious-looking sausage.
He laughs, sure that she got the hint.
Ms. Ellen
Oh, and what a nice alarm clock. Thank you, Stan.
Stan
Bluuch.
Losing patience, Wendy thumps her desk and glares at him.
Ms. Ellen
And here's another present...from Wendy. [She opens it.] Oh. Why, it's a dead animal.
Holds it up for all to see.
Ms. Ellen
Thank you, Wendy.
Wendy is now irate that Ms. Ellen didn't fold.
Stan
See? She liked my present the best!
Kyle
Where's your present, Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, well, I got Ms. Ellen a chocolate pie, but uuuuh-I left it at home.
The left corner of his mouth tells a different story.
Ms. Ellen
Okay, kids. We're gonna take a spelling test now. [All gasp.] But as an extra incentive I'm gonna take whoever gets the highest score on the quiz out to dinner.
The boys except Cartman perk up.
Cartman
Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
Ms. Ellen
Are there any questions before we begin?
Wendy raises her hand.
Ms. Ellen
Yes, Wendy?
Wendy
When someone gets as old as you,
Cartman takes a bite out of the chocolate pie.
Wendy
Do they have to wear Depends undergarments?
Ms. Ellen looks dismayed. Wendy just looks back.
The Cafeteria. The boys are in line for lunch
Kyle
Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
Stan
No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
Wendy approaches with Bebe, both carrying their lunches.
Wendy
Hi, Stan.
Stan
I bet I scored 100!
Wendy
HI, STAN!
Stan
Oh, hi, Wendy.
Wendy
I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.
Kyle
No, she wasn't!
Wendy
Yes, she was!
Stan
That's impossible!
Wendy
Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!
Cartman
Nuh-uh!
Wendy
It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
Kyle
Oh cool.
Cartman
Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
Kyle
Yeah. You're acting like a freak, Wendy.
Wendy
NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!!
She realizes she has made a spectacle of herself as her voice echoes all over the room. Everyone in the cafetera looks at her. She moves away, humbled. Bebe follows.
Cartman
Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass.
They go in to get their lunches.
Chef
[Somberly.] Hello there, children.
Cartman
Oh, hi, Chef.
Kyle
How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Chef
Not too good.
Stan
What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
Chef
No, nono, she's not like that. You see... uh, how do I put this? Children,... Ms. Ellen doesn't exactly play for the right team.
They wait...
Chef
Ih-ih-ih-in in other words, children, she's not a member of the...heterosexual persuasion.
They just blink at him.
Chef
Don't you understand? She's a lesbian.
Stan
A whatbian?
Kyle
A plebeian?
Chef
You boys don't know what a lesbian is?
Stan
Kenny?
Kenny throws his palms up. He doesn't know, either.
Stan
No, explain it to us, Chef.
Chef
Hud-that-that's okay. Uhd-uh, look. All you need to know is, Ms. Ellen's a lesbian, and that means she only likes other lesbians.
Stan
Oh.
Chef
Now move along, children, you're holding up the line!
They head back into the cafeteria.
Kyle
Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?
Stan
Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
Kyle
Hey, yeah!
Cartman
You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
Stan
You're just saying that, Cartman.
Kyle
Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fat-ass.
Cartman
I am, too!
Tom's Rhinoplasty
Tom
Okay, only a few more bandages to go.
Mr. Garrison
Well?
Tom
Take a look for yourself.
Mr. Garrison takes the mirror and sees a reflection of himself - as David Hasselhoff. He will look this way from now on.
Mr. Garrison
Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?
Mr. Hat
I think it looks great.
Tom
Yes. I think once the swelling goes down you'll really notice the difference.
Cartman's house, after school. He's on the living room floor licking the carpet. His friends enter.
Stan
What the hell are you doing, Cartman?
Cartman
My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
Kyle
Really?
Stan
Well I got a...Indi-glo...Girls CD. The guy at the record store said it was perfect.
He pops the CD into the stereo.
Kyle
And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
Stan and Kyle promptly join Cartman on the floor. Kenny studies them for a moment, drops down and thinks a bit, then starts licking.
Indiglo Girls singer
I woke up very early one Sunday morn...

Cartman
This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
Sidewalk. The camera focuses on a pair of feet as they begin to move. The camera pans up to reveal Mr. Garrison walking down the street to the beat of Andy Gibb's Shadow Dancing. He stops by a woman in a yellow blouse and red skirt.
Mr. Garrison
Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
Mrs. Campbell
[Breathlessly.] Oh, How-dy Mr. Garrison. Se-hey, honey, you look kinda differe-hent-huh.
Mr. Garrison
Really?
Mrs. Campbell
Did you get a haircut?
Mr. Garrison
No, but thanks for asking.
He moves down the street.
Mrs. Campbell
[Waving at him.] Call me! I'm in the book!
Mr. Garrison
Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.
Wendy's house. Bebe is at the door
Wendy
Thanks for coming over, Bebe.
She follows Wendy to the sofa.
Bebe
That's okay, Wendy. I brought my makeup kit like you asked me. What are we doing, anyway?
Wendy
That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.
Bebe
Really?
Wendy
Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.
Bebe
Oh, cool.
Day three, the classroom.
Stan
I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
Cartman
I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
Stan
No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
Kyle
Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!
Clyde
Whoa.
All eyes look right.
Clyde
Is that Wendy Testaburger?
Heads turn. Cartman smiles, Wendy had a makeover all right. She comes in dressed in a two-piece leather suit, blush, eyeshadow... A (candy?) cigarette hangs from her lips and her hair is feathered out. She walks in with an air of sophistication and then takes out the cigarette. A smoky tune plays as she enters. The guys in class are rather pleased at this makeover.
Wendy
Hi guys, what's up?
Cartman
Wow. Wendy looks just like that chick from Grease, Elton John.
Stan smiles and his eyes follow her to her desk.
Stan
Wow. Hi, Wendy.
Wendy
Oh. Hi, Stan.
She turns to Bebe and whispers.
Wendy
I think it worked, Bebe.
Bebe
[Pleased.] Yeah.
Ms. Ellen
Good morning, children.
She, too, comes in wearing a two-piece leather suit.
Stan
Wow!
Wendy and Bebe are devastated.
Cartman
Dang! That's nice!
Kyle
Yeah!
Ms. Ellen
Oh, Wendy! You wore black leather, too!
Wendy is mortified.
Ms. Ellen
We're like sisters!
Wendy
DIE!!
Stan rests his head on his hands and melts into a wavy smile while Cartman is overjoyed.
Ms. Ellen
All right, kids, I've finished grading your papers and the person with the highest score is-
Mr. Garrison
Hello there, children!
Shadow Dancing starts up again and he dances. The class just looks at him.
Stan
Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
Cartman
Oh, weak, dude!
Wendy
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!
Triumphal music plays as she leaps out of her desk and somersaults her way to the teacher's desk. She lands next to Ms. Ellen, she starts doing a little cheer.
Wendy
He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.
Mr. Garrison
Children, I have a very important announcement to make.
The class listens.
Mr. Garrison
I'm quitting my job as a teacher.
All gasp and the music dies.
Wendy
Wwhat?
Mr. Garrison
It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.
Wendy
You...you can't.
Mr. Garrison
But the good news is,
Principal Victoria appears at the door.
Mr. Garrison
I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher.
Stan smiles.
Class
Hooray!
Wendy is deflated again.
Ms. Ellen
Really?
Principal Victoria
That's right. Will you stay?
Ms. Ellen
Wel...sure!
Wendy can barely contain herself.
Wendy
Noooo! Noooo!
Ms. Ellen
Oh. By the way, kids, the person who scored highest on the quiz and gets to have dinner on me...is...Stan.
Stan
Bluuch. Kick ass!
Wendy
Nooo!! Nooo!!
Principal Victoria
Oh, and Wendy, I almost forgot, we just got a call in the office: your grandma just died.
Wendy
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Principal Victoria
Oh, my! What an exciting day!
Mr. Garrison is in a photo shoot, posing away as Shadow Dancing plays.
Photographer
Great, baby, you're looking great!
Mr. Garrison
I'm a lady killer, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
Photographer
Okay, just a few hundred more shots and we'll be done!
Mr. Garrison
A few hundred?
Photographer
Hey, that's the life of a model, baby.
Mr. Garrison
Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.
Photographer
You've got it! [The photo-shoot continues.]
Dinner at King Jimmy's Buffet. Stan and Ms. Ellen are at a booth. Dinner music is playing while thunder rolls by.
Ms. Ellen
I'm - very - glad we can have dinner together, Stanley. I want you to know that I really care about your education.
Stan
Are we making love now?
Ms. Ellen
Excuse me?
Stan
They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
Ms. Ellen
What are you talking about?
Stan
You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
Ms. Ellen
Stan, I'm your teacher, okay? We're only friends.
Stan
But why?
Ms. Ellen
Well first of all, you're eight.
Stan
It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
Ms. Ellen
Oh boy.
Wendy stands outside the restaurant looking at the pair through a window clear across the room. The music takes on a somber tone.
Wendy
It's over. I give up.
She turns and walks away.
Day four, the center of town. Mr. Garrsion leans against a mailbox.
Mr. Garrison
Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.
Mr. Hat
You can say that again, Mr. Garrison.
A crowd of women is heard coming Garrison's way.
Mr. Garrison
What the...?
The women appear and mob Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.
They rip open his shirt.
Mr. Garrison
Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself!
Mr. Hat flies out of the fray.
The classroom. Students are filing in and going to their seats
Kyle
So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
Cartman
Did you make love?
Stan
I think so.
Cartman
No way!
Stan
Yup.
Kyle
Down by the fire?
Stan
Yup.
Kenny
(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
Stan
Did I what?
Ms. Ellen enters.
Ms. Ellen
Good morning, children.
Wendy approaches subdued.
Wendy
Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?
Ms. Ellen
Sure, but...can't it wait until after class, Wendy?
Wendy
No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
Ms. Ellen
Oh, that's okay, Wendy.
Wendy
No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.
Ms. Ellen
Well, I would love that, Wendy.
Wendy
And - ahem - I want to apologize to everybody. The way I acted was wrong,
Stan frowns. Sad music plays.
Wendy
...and I've learned from it.
Her eyes begin to well up with tears.
Wendy
I just wish...Stan, and Ms. Ellen, would have all the happiness in the world.
Ms. Ellen
Wendy, there's nothing between me and Stan!
Cartman
That's not what we just heard!
The sidewalk. Mr. Garrison is next to a trash can. His shirt and pants are torn to bits. The top of Mr. Hat's hat is missing.
Mr. Garrison
Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job.
The women find him and rush towards him.
Woman
Oh my God, did he...?
Mr. Garrison
Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!
He pants.
Mr. Garrison
We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again!
He enters Ton's Rhinoplasty again, the women rush by, and he peeks out from behind the window. So much for looking like David Hasselhoff...
The classroom.
Ms. Ellen
Okay, children, let's catch up on our cursive handwriting.
A commotion is heard in the hall, then Arab soldiers burst through the door and pour into the classroom with their swords drawn.
Leader
Down! Down! Everybody down!
Cartman
What the hell...?
Everybody drops down below their desks.
Leader
So! We meet again, Ms. Ellen!
Principal Victoria
And just what is going on here, mister?
Leader
I am Hakeem Korashki, of the mighty nation of Iraq! This woman is a traitor to our government!
Ms. Ellen
It's a lie!
Korashki
She has killed thousands, and will kill again, I assure you!
Principal Victoria
Ms. Ellen, is this true?
Ms. Ellen
Nooo!
Korashki
We must take her back to Iraq immediately!
Wendy
Oh, coool!
Ms. Ellen
Principal Victoria, please.
Korashki
Here is a black-and-white photo of Ms. Ellen with our leader. [Shows photo.] Her real name is Makesh Alak Makarakesh.
Principal Victoria
Well, Ms. Makaraqesh, you certainly tried to put one over on us, boy howdy. Take her away!
Ms. Ellen
NOOOO!!
She grabs the scimitar away from a soldier.
Ms. Ellen
GET AWAY FROM ME!! UUGH!!
The scimitar leaves her hand and heads for Kenny. It pierces him right above the nose, picks him up, and pins him to the back wall.
Stan
Oh my God, she killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Ms. Ellen is being dragged out the door by the soldeirs.
Ms. Ellen
NOOOOOOO!!
Wendy
Wow.
The kids take their seats.
Wendy
What incredible irony.
School entrance. helicopters are hovering around, an ambulance and Officer Barbrady hold the crowd
back. Stan is standing next to Wendy.

Stan
Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
Wendy
Yeah, you just never know.
Stan
Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
Wendy
Happy Valentine's Day, Staan.
She turns to kiss him. He turns to kiss her. Wendy's theme plays. They get closer, then...
Stan
Bluuuuch!
Right in her mouth.
Wendy
Eeewwww!
Wendy quickly wipes the vomit from her mouth, Stan looks away, embarrased.
Stan
Sorry.
Wendy
No, it's okay, Stan!
Stan looks at her.
Wendy
Everything's going to be o-kay!
Kyle
Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
Cartman takes a big bite out of a cardboard box.
Cartman
Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
Iraqi desert. Military maneuvers are taking place. The camera stops at a rocket waiting to be launched.
Korashki
For crimes against this country, you are hereby sentenced to be shot into the center of the sun!
Ms. Ellen
Egh.
She is moved to the rocket.
Ms. Ellen
This is all a mistake!
She is thrown in the rocket.
Ms. Ellen
This can't be happening!
She pops up, the rocket door is shut, and the rocket is fired up.
Ms. Ellen
Pleease! For the love of God!
Korashki
Shove off!!
The rocket takes off and heads for the sun.
Wendy's house, pool party
Mrs. Campbell
Wo-hoo-hoo! Great party, Wendy!
Wendy
Thanks, Mrs. Campbell. Thanks for helping me get Mr. Garrison to come back as a teacher.
Mrs. Campbell
Anything for you, sugar-pie!
Wendy sees Kyle come up.
Wendy
Oh, hi, Kyle!
Kyle
I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
Wendy
U-huh. Excuse me.
Some Iraqi soldiers approach to talk to Wendy.
Wendy
Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!
Iraqi
Ka fahra qetlaq humblaq! [Greetings...]
Wendy
Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!
Iraqi
Kuhla shaluah lakhenblaturtulah!
Wendy
Kaqemblaq!
Wendy throws them a wad of bills.
Iraqi
Ah, laqeh blakatah!]
They walk away miffed.
Kyle
How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
Wendy
Wait, wait!
She throws off her sunglasses and reaches down.
Wendy
It's time to whip out the eclipse shoe-box thing!
She puts it up to her left eye, then smiles. She is looking at the rocket fired off by the Iraqis some time earlier as it nears the sun. She sees the impact.
Wendy
Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.
Kyle
Wendy! You didn't!
Wendy
I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger!
Kyle is shocked.
Southwest Colorado, Site B. The kids are on a field trip
Anthropologist
...And so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust. We dig them up, polish them off, and find over twelve new arrowheads every month.
Cartman
Boooriing.
The class laughs.
Mr. Garrison
Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep.
Under the morning edition of the ROCKY MTN. NEWS, with Mr. Hankey as the lead story.
Anthropologist
Now, can anybody tell me, who left these arrowheads here?
Stan
Isn't that your job?
Anthropologist
Well... yes, but I want to see if you're learning anything.
Stan
Oooh.
Anthropologist
Okay, I tell you what. Why don't we all grab our little anthropology pickaxes - that were handed out and we wuh dig for our very own Indian arrowheads.
The class cheers, scatters, get some pickaxes and start picking away at the site.
Cartman
Day is never finished,
Massa got me working
Someday Massa set me free...

Stan
Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
Pip
Oh! Oh I think I found one!
Reaching down for an arrowhead.
Cartman takes notice.
Cartman
No, I found it.
Pip
Oh. I do believe I found it first.
Cartman
No, I did, Pip.
Pip
Oh dear.
Cartman
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it.
Pip
What do you mean?
Cartman
Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
Pip
Oh. By, weh. I suppose if I must.
Cartman
Okay, ready? I'll go first.
Cartman back up, then runs at Pip, and kicks him in the nuts. Pip goes down in pain. The other kids laugh.
Pip
Well-uh I, I guess you win.
Cartman
Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it.
Tosses it back to Pip. The kids resume digging.
Cartman
Day is never finished,
Massa got me working...

Oh, look, I found another one.

He looks it over.
Cartman
Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle!
He tosses this one away, as well. It lands before Kyle.
Kyle
Whoa. Check it out, dude.
Kyle picks up the triangle.
Kyle
It's got little drawings on it.
Stan comes over to check it out.
Stan
What is it?
Kyle
I don't know.
The triangle flickers, then glows for a moment.
Stan
Whoa!
Kyle
That was cool!
Cartman rushes over.
Cartman
Eeyy! Give me that back!
Kyle
You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
Cartman
We'll ro-sham-bo for it!
Kyle
No way, fatty, it's mine!
Cartman
ANTHROPOLOGIST!
Anthropologist
[Strolling over.] How's it going, boys?
Cartman
I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
Kyle
You threw it away, fatso!
Anthropologist
Hm, let me see that. [Examines it.] Why, this is Anasazi writing! My God, this must be thousands of years old!
Cartman
[To Kyle.] Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it!
Kyle takes the triangle from the anthropologist and walks away.
News 4, Special Report.
Anchor
...and finally tonight, a young boy from South Park, Colorado found something very interesting during a field trip today. Here with a special report is a quadriplegic Swiss man on a pony.
Quadriplegic Swiss man
Thanks, Tom, the little eight year old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object.
Kyle
Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
Cartman
...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
Kyle
[Off camera,] You liar, Cartman!
Cartman
Screw you, triangle thief!
Quadriplegic Swiss man
And so, the little boy will take his discovery home and perhaps donate it to science... mwell a little later. Back to you, Dave.
Dave
Thanks Tom. Those are some cute, cute kids, except for that last one-he's a little tubby.
Cartman pops up before the camera.
Cartman
Eeyy!
Kyle's house. The boys have returned from their trip.
Stan
What are you going to do with it, dude?
Kyle
I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
Cartman
Oh I'll find it, don't worry!
Kyle enters his room and closes the door. Cartman rushes up to it and jumps on the door knob.
Cartman
God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
Stan
You did throw it away, Cartman.
Cartman
I was just setting it aside.
Stan
Well, you might as well let it go.
Cartman
Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
School cafeteria. Chef is preparing a dish.
Chef
Give me a little bit of that pepper
Give me a little bit of that salt
Put it in the skillet and cook it...

Leonard Maltin
Excuse me, sir...
Chef
Can I help-ey, you're that movie critic - guy on TV.
Leonard Maltin
Leonard Maltin, yes.
Chef
Well, I'll be a teenage girl backstage at am Aerosmith concert. Leonard Maltin in my cafeteria. I'm Chef.
Leonard Maltin
I know who you are. You must listen to me, Chef. We have precious little time. Have you seen Barbra Streisand recently?
Chef
Barbra Streisand? You mean like, the Barbra Streisand?
Leonard Maltin
Have you seen her?!
Chef
No. Not since Yentl.
Leonard Maltin
Thank God. Then I'm not too late.
Chef
Too late for what?
Leonard Maltin
Chef, it is of the utmost importance that you tell me where those little boys from the news report on TV are.
Chef
Why do you care?
The bus stop. Stan and Kyle are working on a snowman as Cartman and Kenny watch.
Stan
I have a button we can use for his nose.
Kenny
(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)
Kyle
What would we use a marble sack for?
Cartman
Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
Kyle
I didn't steal anything.
Cartman looks away so as to not see Kyle.
Cartman
Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
Kyle
Good!
Kyle looks back as helicopter blades are heard.
Cartman
What's that noise?
A pink helicopter descends.
Kyle
Whoa!
Cartman
Aaah! Aliens!
Cartman covers his butt. The helicopter lands, the door opens, and Barbra Streisand appears.
Barbra Streisand
Who is the boy I saw on the news report tonight?
Stan and Kenny point at Kyle.
Barbra Streisand
Hello there, little boy. Do you know who I am?
Kyle
No.
Barbra Streisand
Ugh. I bet you do.}}
I'm going-

Kyle
Aagh! Stop that!
Barbra Streisand
-where there's lucky clovers in the f-

Stan
Ow, that sucks, dude!
Barbra Streisand
I'm Barbra Streisand!
Stan
...so?
Barbra Streisand
So?! Uh muh, so I'm a very famous and very important individual.
Stan
Like John Elway important?
Barbra Streisand
What?!
Stan
D'you know John Elway?
Barbra Streisand
No!
Stan
Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
Barbra Streisand
Ugh. Look. Little boy, I understand that you found a neat little triangle near here, you know what I'm talking about?
Kyle
Yyeeaahh.
Cartman
No! I found it, he stole it!
Kyle
You threw it away, Cartman!
Cartman
I'm not talking to him, because he's a dirty thief.
Barbra Streisand
Well, little boy, does the triangle have a symbol of two snakes joined at the middle?
Kyle
Yeah. How'd you know?
Barbra Streisand
Okay, now this is very important. Where is the triangle of Zinthar now?
Kyle
Triangle of Zinthar?
Stan
Why do you wanta know, lady?!
Barbra Streisand
I'm not talking to you, you piss-ant little hick!
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Barbra Streisand
Where is the triangle, dammit?!
She picks up Kyle by the throat.
Kyle
AAAAAA!
Barbra drops Kyle as Officer Barbrady approaches.
Officer Barbrady
What seems to be the problemo here?
Barbra Streisand
Problemo? Huh, There's no problemo, Officer. I was just introducing myself to these charming little boys.
Cartman
Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!
Officer Barbrady
Boys, shouldn't you be in school?
Stan
It's Saturday.
Officer Barbrady
No excuses, move along, you little troublemakers!
The boys leave. Kyle lucked out.
Barbra faces Officer Barbrady.
Barbra Streisand
...Well?!
Officer Barbrady
Well what?
Barbra Streisand
You know who I am, don't you?
Officer Barbrady
Well, you ain't Fiona Apple, and if you ain't Fiona Apple, I don't give a rat's ass!
Barbra Streisand
Waaaaaaah!
She leaves in a huff.
Officer Barbrady
Hoh, what a bitch!
Kyle's house. Chef and Leonard Maltin are at the door
Chef rings the bell and knocks.
Chef
I guess he's not home, Leonard Maltin.
Leonard Maltin
Damn! Then we must look for them elsewhere.
Chef
Come on, man. What is this all about?
Leonard Maltin
If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger. If you were Barbra Streisand, where would you be right now?
Chef
Hmmm.
A picture of Tom's Rhinoplasty pops into his head.
Leonard Maltin
Nono! I mean, where would she be staying?
Chef
Oh. Uh, well, I always heard that Ms. Streisand had her own $4 million condominium - up near the ski slope.
Leonard Maltin
Where?
Chef
Uh I don't know. Ih-ih it was just a rumor.
Leonard Maltin
Dammit man, where's your car?!
Barbra Streisand's four million dollar condo in the mountains.
Barbra Streisand
He has it, Milo. That little bastard has the triangle.
Milo
Are you sure?
Barbra Streisand
I'm sure! He knew about the symbol of Krewluck!
Milo
Then why don't we go get it?
Barbra Streisand
A cop showed up - he's a clever one - I can't blow everything now that I'm this close. Everything must be handled very carefully.
She goes to some bookshelves and pulls on a book, on the top of which is a secret button. She presses the button and the shelf rotates to reveal a pedestal with two holders. One triangle is already in one holder, the other one is still alone.
Barbra Streisand
How many years has it been, Milo? Thirty? Forty? For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!
She laughs rather hysterically.
Kyle's bedroom. He's asleep. A model of the solar system, a picture of him and his elephant, and the Triangle of Zinthar can be seen on his dresser. The camera pans up to see a saw cutting through the ceiling. The hole is made and the cut piece is pushed unto the floor. Kyle flinches and turns around, now facing the wall. A rope comes down and footfalls are heard. Kyle adjusts himself. A pair of eyes looks around and sees the triangle, then Kyle, then back to the triangle. The eyes approach and two hands reach out to grab the triangle.
Ike
Cokeshen.
Cartman is distracted, knocking down the picture, waking up Kyle.
Kyle
Cartman?
Cartman
[Revealing himself.] You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
Kyle
What the hell are you doing?!
Cartman
I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
Ike
Rear trohtru badt.
Kyle
Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
Ike
Cookeh monter.
Cartman
Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddamn son of a bitch!!
Ike
Ahtoahtahneurah.
Kyle gets out of bed.
Kyle
Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
Cartman
Huh?!
Kyle
If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!
Kyle hands him the triangle.
Kyle
There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
Cartman looks at the triangle.
Cartman
Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.
I got the triangle,
I got the triangle,
dee dun dee dun

He backs up and goes out the door. Kyle goes back to sleep. Meanwhile, in Chef's Town and Country, He and Maltin are driving around.
Leonard Maltin
Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?
Chef
It was just a rumor. A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.
Leonard Maltin
Then we've got to keep looking.
Chef
[Braking hard.] Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain't drivin' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!
Leonard Maltin
Haven't you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?
Chef
Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.
Leonard Maltin
More than a bitch! She's a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.
Chef
Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?
Leonard Maltin
When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.
Chef
Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don't need to know all this!
Starts up the station wagon.
Chef
Forget I asked!
Leonard Maltin
Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl's wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of My Fair Lady, Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.
Chef
And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?
Leonard Maltin
Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!
Chef
Mega-Streisand? Oh, man, I don't know what the hell that means, but it doesn't sound good.
The bus stop, Monday.
Stan
Man, the bus sure is late.
Cartman
Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
Kyle
Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
Barbra Streisand pulls up in her car wearing a Groucho Marx face mask, and steps out.
Barbra Streisand
Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?
Stan
Fine.
Barbra Streisand
That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.
The four boys stand silent.
Barbra Streisand
I hear that one of you found my triangle.
Kyle
Your triangle?
Barbra Streisand
Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I'm so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.
Cartman
Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
Barbra Streisand
But I'll die.
Cartman
Well, I guess we'll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...
Barbra Streisand
I want to give you a big cash reward for finding it. It's worth a lot of money to me.
Cartman
It is?
Stan
Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
Barbra Streisand
Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?
Kyle
Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45.
The boys laugh and Barbra seethes.
Stan
Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on.
The boys laugh again and Barbra gets angrier.
Cartman
Yeeh, stealth bombers.
The boys laughs some more.
Cartman
Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-
Barbra Streisand
ENOUGH!!
The boys are suddenly horrified.
Barbra Streisand
Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you'll come with me in my car, I'll take you up to my condo where I'll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - money - for the triangle.
Cartman
Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!
Heads for the car.
Kyle
Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers?
Cartman
No, not when money is involved, stupid!
The kids climb into her car and Barbra revs it up.
Fanfare. Hollywood, at Direct to Video Studios.
Director
And. Action!
Sidney Poitier
[To Sally Struthers.] Rebecca, I'm a man. A man like any other with dreams and emotions. And that's why I'll never put a foreign object up my ass.
Director
Cut, great, print that. Excellent work, Sid. Take five, guys, let's set up for the next shot.
Sidney heads for his dressing room, enters, and heads for the mirror.
A clam shell opens up revealing two tiny princesses.
Princesses
Hello.
Sidney Poitier
Huh?
Princesses
You must hurry! A young man has found the Triangle of Zinthar.
Sidney Poitier
Where?
Princesses
At a small piss-ant white-bread mountain town in Colorado called South Park.
Sidney Poitier
Excellent!
Back at Barbra's condo.
Barbra Streisand
Eh. Soon, the triangle of Zinthar will be mine, and I will be the biggest, most famous person ever!
Cartman is strapped to a rack, the others hang from chains.
Cartman
Ugh. Let me go! Seriously!
Stan
Yeah, let us go!
Barbra Streisand
You fools have no idea the powers that you are meddling with! I'll teach you to meddle with my triangle!
Pulls the lever next to her.
The ropes start to tighten on the rack.
Cartman
Eey! It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!
Kyle
Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fat-ass!
Cartman
Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.
Barbra Streisand
Wheeere is the triangle of Zinthar?!
Cartman
I don't remember.
Kyle
Goddammit tell her! I wanna go home!
Barbra Streisand
[Slowly.] Maybe this will help jar your memory...
Cartman
No! Don't!
She starts singing again and the kids scream with pain.
Cartman
AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
Barbra Streisand
NOOOW do you remember?!
Cartman
WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!
Stan
Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
Barbra Streisand
Alright. You asked for it!
I'm gonna tell you now...

The boys resume their screaming.
Chef's Town and Country. Still looking...
Chef
Eeeeh-I don't know, man. Maybe Barbra Streisand doesn't have a place up here after all.
Leonard Maltin
Well, looks like we'll have to go to plan B.
Chef
There's a plan B? Why the hell have we been driving around all night and day for, when there's a plan B.
Leonard Maltin
Have you ever heard of the band called, The Cure?
Chef
Ooh, come oonn! Don't tell me The Cure has something to do with this too!
Leonard Maltin
No, no. Just the lead singer. [He starts convulsing.] Oh! Ah!
Chef
Who-o-oa! What's the matter, Leonard Maltin?
Leonard Maltin
She's close! She's very close-I can feel her.
Chef
Where?
Leonard Maltin
Sh-She has the boys! The, they're in trouble!
Chef
Ooh, fudge!
Leonard Maltin
Keep going this way! Hurry!
They round a bend and disappear.
The condo.
Barbra Streisand
Happiness with you is like happiness...

The boys are still screaming.
Cartman
Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is, it's inside my shoe.
Milo approaches and removes Cartman's right shoe.
Kyle
Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
Cartman
I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
Milo hands the triangle to Barbra.
Barbra Streisand
Finally, the triangle is mine! After centuries of waiting, I finally have the triangle of Zinthar! Now, the Diamond of Pantheos is complete.
Barbra joins the triangles and the resulting diamond begins to spin and glow.
Barbra Streisand
Sugoi! Kono ima... atarashii hajimari da! Ima kara... atashi no na mae wa... (Wow! This is... a new beginning! From now on... my name will be...)
A strobe flash goes off when the diamond reaches the height of its brilliance, and the pedestal the diamonds were on shines very brightly thereafter.
Stan
Whoa, dude!
Flashes of light continue to escape the diamond, and Barbra beings to transform.
Barbra Streisand
...Mecha... Barbura... Sutoraisando!
She grows as she transforms, breaking through the roof, then lets out a roar and leaves her condo as a giant mechanical lizard.
Stan
Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
South Park. Mecha Streisand arrives.
Jimbo
Holy crap, Ned! That's the biggest Goddamned deer I have ever seen!
Reporter
...and so, just weeks after the devastating attack of mutant genetic creatures, zombies, and Thanksgiving turkeys, the town of South Park has managed to rebuild itself, once again be-
Mecha Streisand appears behind him, holding a car, and lets out a roar as she devours it.
Reporter
Oh, Goddammit, not again!
She rips the roof off the new Sushi Bar.
Singer
Bar-bura, Bar-bura...
[she crushes the sushi bar with her foot]
...kirai no hito. (you are so hateful)
[She steps off the sushi bar. The Mayor is watching from her window across the street]
Bar-bura, Bar-bura...
[Mecha Streisand throws the roof away, then rips the roof off the building next to it, grabs two people, but drops one of them]
...anata no hi. (today is your day)
[The Mayor looks on, mortified. Her door opens]

Assistant
Mayor! Barbra Streisand is-
Mayor
I noticed! Call the National Guard!
Her assistant leaves as Mecha Streisand roars again.
Mayor
Ohohohoh, we'll get you, you bitch.
Mecha Streisand grabs the building and shakes the people out of it.
Mayor
And to think I actually watched your HBO special.
The condo. Chef and Leonard Maltin arrive.
Chef
Children!
The boys
Chef!
Leonard Maltin notices the gaping hole in the ceiling.
Leonard Maltin
Oh no! No! She has joined the two triangles?
Cartman
Yes! She stole my triangle!
Stan
Get us down from here!
Chef tries to remove the chains from Stan's wrists.
Chef
I can't - break these - locks!
Leonard Maltin
Stand back, Chef!
Chef stands back as Leonard Maltin does a few martial arts moves.
Leonard Maltin
Marutam Re!
His eyes send out laser beams. He first frees Stan and Kyle, then Cartman and Kenny.
Kyle
Whoa, that was cool!
Leonard Maltin
I've got to go after Mecha Streisand! Chef, I need you to call Robert Smith of The Cure at this number!
Stan
Robert Smith? Sweet!
A studio. Robert Smith picks up the phone.
Robert Smith
Hello?
Chef
Uuuh, yes. Is this Robert Smith of the Cure?
Robert Smith
Yes i' is.
Chef
This may sound kind of strange, but... Leonard Maltin asked me to call you.
Robert Smith
Ooooooh so Barbra Streisand's found the other triangle, eh?
Chef is stunned.
South Park. Looks pretty devastated. The National Guard is pulling in.
Sergeant
All right, men, give 'er everything you've got!
Mecha Streisand roars down at them, and they fire rockets at her from all around, to no effect. Helicopters surround her and fire away. Jimbo and Ned are in one of them, with Ned piloting.
Jimbo
Get around th' side there, Ned. I can't get a shot in from here.
Ned circles around to her face.
Ned
Okay. Aah! aah! I'm scaared!
Jimbo fires a shoulder rocket, but it just bounces off her shoulder. She rears back and swats Their helicopter out of the sky. The other helicopters scatter.
Singer
Bar-bura, Bar-bura, ugoina chichi da.
(Barbra, Barbra, those tits are wonderful)

Sergeant
[To his commander.] It's no use! Our firepower has no effect!
Sheila
Oh my God, it is you! Oh, I am such a huge fan, Ms. Streisand. I never thought I'd live to see you in person!
Mecha Streisand roars back.
Sheila
I hate to ask this, but could I get an autograph? My sister would die.
Mecha Streisand roars assent and stoops to sign the autograph book.
Sheila
Oh thank you, Ms. Streisand!
Mecha Streisand roars in triumph and rounds a corner. Everybody runs.
Citizen
Oh my Goooodd! [Amid screams.]
Mr. Garrison
We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat.
Singer
Bar-bura, Bar-bura!

She stops before Leonard Maltin.
Leonard Maltin
Barbra!
She steps back surprised, then roars.
Leonard Maltin
Kitte, Kitte. Churipu. (Come, come. Tulip!)
Leonard Maltin begins to transform.
Singer
Ultura Lenardu Marutin!

Lenardu Marutin shows off some moves. Mecha Streisand respnds by kicking away the ushi bar. Chef and the boys arrive just after that. Lenardu Marutin grabs the building next to the bar and hits her with it, causing her to fall back.
Chef
Look out, children!
Townspeople run by, then the boys scream and scatter. Jimbo's Guns lands where they were standing. Mecha Streisand kicks Lenardu Marutin in the groin and he lands on his back, but Chef and the boys have to scatter again before he does. Stan and Kyle regroup and look at the scene, but Kyle turns around for some reason. Kenny is seen running towards a tetherball. He hits it with his left hand. It swings around and swoops him up.
Kenny
(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)
Kenny dies strangled by the tether-ball.
Kenny
(Ugh!)
Stan
Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
Kyle
You bastard!
Sidney Poitier flies in like Superman and lands next to Chef.
Sidney Poitier
What's going on here?
Chef
Sidney Poitier?
Sidney Poitier
That's right. I'm Sidney Poitier.
Chef
Damn, man, it's nice to meet you! Seein' Sidney Poitier in my hometown!
Sidney Poitier
Barbra Streisand has found the triangle of Zinthar?
Chef
Yeup! She's made the Diamond of Pantheos alright.
Sidney Poitier
Kolooh kulatchki!
Sidney Poitier begins transforming.
Singer
Megara Poatia,
Megara Poatia,
sokuroi da ne.
(Megara Poatia Megara Poatia. Look, how black you are.)
[Megara Poatia takes off and spins towards Mecha Streisand.]
Megara Poatia, Megara Poatia-

Chef
[Annoyed.] Is that really necessary?
Mecha Streisand fends off Lenardu Marutin, then picks up Megara Poatia and twirls him around in an airplane move and throws him onto a mountain. He bounces over the top and away. The boys are shocked. Lenardu Marutin fixes his gaze on her, but she blocks it with her right hand. She then breathes a plasma blast at him, which lands hard and knocks him onto his back.
Chef
It's over. She's too strong for them, children. We'll have to leave town.
Cartman
Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her!
Cartman covers his eyes.
Stan
My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
Chef
We have to say good-bye... to South Park.
Woman
Oh my Goooood, help meeee!
Mecha Streisand is tearing up the town, ripping apart some buildings, stomping on others...
Robert Smith
Am I too late?
Chef
[Irritated.] Who are you?
Stan
Dude! Robert Smith of the Cure!
Cartman
Sweet!
Robert Smith
Here, you boys hold this walkie, you can help me fight her.
Chef
You can try, Robert Smith, but that thing just beat the crap out of Leonard Maltin and Sidney Poitier.
Robert Smith
I have to try. I can't let Barbra Streisand do this to the entire world.
Robert Smith begins transformation into a giant moth.
Singer
Rabartu Smitu,
Rabartu Smitu,
tashiwa daisuki Rabartu Smitu.
(Robert Smith, Robert Smith, I like you a lot, Robert Smith)

Mecha Streisand heads for a gas station with a dinosaur for its symbol, but Rabartu Smitu comes up fast behind her. She notices. He shrieks at her, she covers her ears, and skyscrapers all around lose their windows. She responds with her own shrieks, and he covers his ears. More skyscrapers lose their windows.
Leonard Maltin
[Back to normal.] We must tell him that her weak point is the nose.
Stan
[Into the walkie.] Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
Rabartu Smitu looks at him and acknowledges the command by lefting the right-hand index and pinky fingers. Mecha Streisand tears apart some power lines and prepares to electrocute him, but he launches his fist. It hits her square on the nose and a diamond falls out, which lands in fron of Kyle.
Kyle
The Diamond of Pantheos. [Looks at Stan.] She must be powerless now.
Stan
[Into the walkie.] Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
Singer
Rabartu Smitu,
Rabartu Smitu!

Chef looks at him more annoyed than before. Rabartu Smitu maneuvers Mecha Streisand around and grabs her by the tail. After some airplane spins he launches her into outer space. An electrical overload occurs and she blows up into millions of pieces. The fireworks can be seen from the town and the townspeople cheer up and down.
Stan
He did it!
Kyle
No more Barbra Streisand, everrrrr!
Stan
Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
Jesus
Our Savior!
Robert Smith transforms back to normal.
Robert Smith
Can I have my walkie-talkie back now, please?
Cartman
No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
Robert Smith
Alright, I'll ro-sham-bo you for it. Ready?
Cartman
Huh?
Cartman gets a kick in the groin and falls. Robert Smith moves aside.
Cartman
Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
Robert Smith walks towards the sunset as Japanese music plays, apparently without the walkie-talkie.
Chef
Hey! Where's he goin'?
Stan
Good-bye, Robert Smith!
Cartman
Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
Kyle
Disintegration is the best album everrr!
Kyle's house.
Stan
Well, what should we do with the two triangles now?
Kyle
We've got to get rid of them.
Kyle heads for a small trash can next to the coffee table.
Kyle
Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted!
He tosses the triangles in.
Stan
Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
Cartman reaches over.
Cartman
No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
Kyle
Dammit Cartman, don't you ever learn anything?!
Stan turns left and walks to the door.
Cartman
Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll ro-sham-bo you for it!
Ike, seeing what Kyle had thrown in, reaches the trash can and jumps in.
Stan
Go to hell, Cartman!
In front of the house.
Kyle
Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
Stan
Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
Kyle
But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
Stan
Yeah.
Cartman
Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!
The steps of a giant are heard and the kids grow fearful] Oh no! She's back!
Stan
Oh my God! Look!
The camera reveals a giant Ike coming out from behind the house.
All three
AAAAA! MECHA IKE!
The bus stop. Kenny, Kyle, and Stan are waiting for the bus
Stan
Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
Kyle
Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
Kenny
(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed.)
The three laugh.
Kyle
Yeah.
Stan
Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him.
The bus pulls up.
Ms. Crabtree
Come on, we're running late!
Stan
We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
Ms. Crabtree
What did you say?!
Stan
I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
Ms. Crabtree
Oh. Alright, then.
She closes the door and drives away.
Kyle
Whoa, dude.
Stan
I always wondered if that would work.
The boys approach Cartman's house. Kyle rings the bell.
Liane
Hello, boys.
Kyle
Hi. We were wondering why fat-ass [Mitt to mouth.] I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
Liane
Ooooh, he's just been feeling under the weather. Maybe you boys can cheer him up. He's in the backyard.
Stan
In the backyard?
In the backyard. A classical piece plays as the camera looks at the picnic table left over from Cartman's birthday. Cartman is at table surrounded by four dolls: he is hosting a tea party. Think Mr. Hat, then the Mad Hatter...
Cartman
Would you like some more tea, Polly Prissy Pants?
Polly
Yes, Eric, I would like some tea. Thank you.
Cartman
You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.
The boys pop up over some bushes and look at Cartman from a distance.
Cartman
Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
Clyde
Yes, please, Eric. Why are you so cool?
Cartman
Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
Polly
You are so strong and smart, Eric. Everybody likes you.
Cartman
Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. [Sips.]
Stan
[Behind the bushes with the others.] Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
Kenny
(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea.)
Kyle
Come on! Let's go make fun of him!
Stan
No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
Kyle
Really?
Peter
[Back at table.] We like ya, Eric. You are the coolest guy in the world. This is tremendous tea.
Cartman
Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
Polly
Eric is the best!
Clyde
Hooray for Eric!
Peter
Eric kicks ass!
At school, the Counselor's office. The boy who saw the counselor in December is back, but then, so is Kyle.
Kyle
Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
Mr. Mackey
Oh, well, there's a news flash!
Stan
Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
Kyle
Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
Mr. Mackey
Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, m'kay?
Kyle
Woo-whataya mean?
Mr. Mackey
Have you boys noticed anything recently that troubled Eric?
Stan
No.
Mr. Mackey
Well-obviously something is bothering him. [looks left] Oh, of course!
Mr. Mackey walks over to a shelf.
Mr. Mackey
My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, m'kay?
Stan
Is that legal?
Mr. Mackey
Oh, hell yes!
Back at Cartman's Tea Party.
Cartman
My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
Polly
Oh, thank you, Eric. You are a perfect gentleman, and you are smart and true.
Peter
Yes, Eric, you are strong and smart and true. Everybody likes you very much.
Cartman
That's niiice, Peter Panda.
Stan and Kyle are back at the bushes with Mr. Mackey's camera.
Stan
Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
Kyle
How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
Stan
I donnow, just keep rolling.
Cartman
More tea, Rumpertumskin?
Rumpertumskin
Yes, please, Eric. You are tough and handsome.
Cartman
Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
Clyde
I think you're a big fat piece of crap.
Cartman, confused of how to take that.
Cartman
Eeeyy!
Cartman's house, later that night. Cartman and his mom are dining when Mr. Kitty comes by.
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
Kitty
Hhhhhcck!
Liane
How is your beefy roast, snookums?
Cartman
Mom? Can I ask you a question?
Liane
Sure, hon.
Cartman
You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
Liane
Uh huuuh.
Cartman
And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
Liane
Yyeess??
They look at each other for a long time.
Liane
Well, what's your question, hon?
Cartman
God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
Liane
Oooooohh.
Cartman
I want to know where I came from.
Liane
Ooohh, hhmmm [Finger to lips.]. Wwell - yyou see, Eric, sometimes when a man and a woman are... attracted to each other, they want to be... close to each other.
Cartman
Uh huuh.
Liane
And sometimes the man puts his who-who-dilly in the woman's cha-cha.
Cartman and his mom look at each other, Kitty looks at them both.
Cartman
So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
Liane
Eric, the day I met your father it was like - magic! It was a beautiful autumn night when the aspen trees were turning, at the Twelfth Annual Drunken Barn Dance.
A flashback sequence begins where a barn appears with a banner: 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance. Cows are standing around while music and light emanate from inside the barn.
Liane
I was young and naive then...
Liane is seen downing a very tall flask of beer.
Man
Man, I've never seen a woman drink that much-you're amazing, Ms. Cartman.
Liane
Oh, heck. I haven't even started yet. He-he. [The band ends its tune.] I baked cookiees; would anybody like one?! [She stands next to Barbrady.]
Trainee Barbrady
I wouldn't mind gettin' ahold of your cookies, Ms. Cartman!
Liane
[Breathlessly.] Well, go right ahead, Officer Barbrady.
Trainee Barbrady
[Takes a cookie and bites into it.] Mm, that's a good cookie! [The band resumes playing.]
Jimbo
Come on everybody, let's do the Drunken Barn Dance!
A duck falls from the ceiling and everybody takes their bottles of beer and toast the occasion. They drop their empty bottles, and Ned ends up falling where he stands.
Liane
And then I saw him. He was the most beautiful, charming piece of ass I'd ever seen in South Park. His name... was Chief Running Water.
The crowd separates to reveal a handsome Indian entering the dance. A song begins.
Singing
There you are, like a throbbing star. I want you to make love to me.

Ms. Cartman and the Chief focus in on each other, then walk to each other, then bump into each other. Ms. Cartman falls, then gets up, vomits, and starts dancing with the Chief.
Liane
I don't recall exactly how the rest of the night went, but the next morning I was pregnant with you, my little blueberry muffin.
Cartman
So where is Chief Running Water-I mean, Dad, now?
Liane
Oh I never saw him after that. Ah-I wasn't really that interested in him.
Cartman
[Weighs the story.] That isn't a very romantic story, Mom.
Liane
I heard he still lives on the Ute reservation just outside of town.
Cartman
Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Native American.
Kitty
Meow.
Cartman
No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
Stan's house. Grandpa, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are watching TV.
Annoncer
Coming this Sunday, [Music begins to play.] a major television event that will blow you away. Terrance. Phillip.
The title screen appears.
Announcer
In the harrowing made-for-TV drama, Not Without My Anus, based on a true story.
Terrance
Hey, Phillip. I have to go to Iraq and find my kidnapped daughter.
Phillip
Then I'm going to go with you, Terrance.
He farts. They both laugh, the music starts up again.
Annoncer
See Canada's hottest stars on the HBC movie of the week.
Stan
Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
Kyle
Yeah, dude. It looks riveting.
Grandpa starts flipping channels.
Stan
Come on Grandpa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
Grandpa
No, Billy. We're gonna watch the Bob Saget show.
Stan
Aaawww.
Kyle
[At the same time.] Hunh?
Annoncer
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos. Here is you host, Bob Saget!
Bob Saget
Hey, I just flew into the studio.
He flaps his right arm like he actually flew in.
Bob Saget
Boy are my arms tired. Heheh. Heh.
Grandpa laughs, but no one in the studio audience is.
Bob Saget
Wha, Why didn't the skeleton cross the road? 'Cause he didn't have the guts.
Only he and Grandpa laugh.
Bob Saget
Knock knock.
The audience stays silent.
Bob Saget
Bob.
Audience is silent.
Bob Saget
Bob Saget..
He chuckles to himself. As if on cue, the audience breaks into laughter and some members fall over. Grandpa falls over, too, and laughs his ass off for a minute or so.
Stan
This guy sucks!
The bell rings and he goes to answer it.
Kyle
Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
Stan opens the door to find Cartman
Stan
Cartman? What the hell are you doing dressed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
Cartman
[Indian music plays.] Native American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people.
He's dressed in Indian clothes (including tassels), with a headband holding three feathers, and an eagle necklace, not a bear one.
Stan
What??
Kyle and Kenny reach the door, look at Cartman, and crack up.
Cartman
Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!
The boys are quiet.
Cartman
Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
Stan
What are you talking about, Cartman?!
Cartman
My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
Stan
Go ahead, dude.
Cartman turns left and leaves to get the bike. The other three return to the sofa to watch TV.
Kyle
Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
Stan
Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
Bob Saget
Just a free li'l reminder to all of you out there: send us your stupidest home videos. Grand prize for this month will be $10,000. [Chuckles.]
Grandpa
Ten thousand dollars? Holy smokes.
Kyle
Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video.
They realize that they do, then look at the videotape, and smile.
UTE Native American Reservation.
Chief Running Water
...And Bear cried to Eagle-
Indian 1
Running Water, there is some kid here to see you.
Chief Running Water
What kid?
Indian 1
He claims to be your kid.
Cartman squeezes his way into the campfire circle.
Cartman
Hiya, Dad!
Chief Running Water
Who the hell are you?
Cartman
I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Chief Running Water
Your mother?
Cartman
Liane Cartman.
Chief Running Water
Cartman? Hohoho. Oh boy, I was worried there for a second. [Suddenly serious.] Look, kid, I'm not your father.
Cartman
But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
Chief Running Water
Kid, I hate to break this to you, but your mother is what we Native Americans refer to as, 'Bear with Wiiide Canyon.'
Cartman
Whatooya mean?
Chief Running Water
She is, 'Doe who cannot keep legs together.'
Cartman
Huh??
Chief Running Water
Your mom's a slut.
The other Utes on either side of him nod in agreement.
Cartman
Eeyy!!
Chief Running Water
Don't feel too bad. Your mom was just too drunk to remember what happened. Let me tell you.
He flashes back to the 12th Annual Drunken Barn Dance.
Chief Running Water
We got tired of dancing, so we went off to find a private spot.
Chief Running Water
There you are...
Chief Running Water
I knew that she wanted me, because she kept saying romantic things.
Liane
Oh, Chief. I want your hot man chowder.
Chief Running Water
Whoa, Helloooh!!
They start kissing. A man vomits and passes out.
Liane
[Interrupting the action.] Wait. Wait.
She looks towards the entrance, and the Chief rolls back.
Liane
] Who is that?
Some funk plays as Chef makes his entrance and waves hello to everyone. She looks at Chef.
Singing
There you are like a throbbing star-

Now these two focus in on each other.
Liane
Chief... could you excuse me for a minute?
Chief Running Water
Huh??
Liane gets up and leaves.
Chief Running Water
You gotta be kidding me.
Liane
[Approaching Chef.] Why hello there. I don't think I've seen you around before. [Flirts with him gently.]
Chef
Nawh. I'm new in town.
Liane
Well, what's a nice, handsome, black [She looks at his crotch. He follows her gaze.] man like yourself doing in a pit like South Park?
Chef
I'm gonna open up my own restaurant here.
Liane
Mmmm-my, how exciting. Would you care to... put your tongue in my mouth?
Chef
Daaamn, baby! You cut right to the chase, don't you?
Liane
Ahah, I'm plastered! [Tongues come out and they start kissing.]
Cartman
[Alone with the Chief] His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
Chief Running Water
He's the last person I saw with your mom that night.
Cartman
Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
Back in town, the following day. Kenny is trying to start a go-cart.
Stan
Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
Kyle
Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
Stan
Yeah. I mailed it last night. What sucks is that now I'll have to actually watch that Bob Saget guy to find out if we won.
Kyle
If we win, we can buy a new go-cart that actually runs.
Stan
[With the right hand cupped to the side of his mouth.] Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
Cartman
[With rap beats playing now.] 'S up, homies?
He's dressed in a red jogging suit and white sneakers. He has a large clock hanging off his necklace and sports a high flat-top. On his right hand are some brass knuckles with the work 'PIE' grafted to them.
Stan
Cartman?!
Cartman
I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
Kyle
You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
Stan
Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
Cartman
[Aloofly.] Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.
Stan and Kyle just look at him.
Cartman
You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad.
He starts to moonwalk away to the sound of scratchin'.
Stan
Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
Kenny finally gets the go-cart going, but is yanked behind it. It won't let him go, and a variation on Mission Impossible begins to play.
Kenny
(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
Stan, Kyle
Hold on, Kenny!
Kenny
(Oof. Oh this Goddamned freakin'-
He hits a bump on the road.
Kenny
(AARGH.)
The go-cart returns and goes into the snow.
Kenny
(Goddamn, why-)
He goes into a tight grove of trees, then exits.
Kenny
(Oh this freakin'-)
He hits a boulder.
Kenny
(AARGH.)
The go-cart lands upside down on some tracks. Kenny gets up and dusts himself off.
Kenny
(Phew.)
The guys look at him and he waves to them.
Kenny
(Well, I'm fine, guys!)
They smile and wave back.
Kenny
(Now if I can-)
A train strike him and the go-cart, obliterating both.
Stan
Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
Kyle
You bastards!
Chef's house. Cartman arrives.
Chef
Hello?
Cartman
Yo, Pops!
Chef
[Studying...] Boy, what the fudge are you doin'?
Cartman
You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
Chef
Get in here! [Drags him in.]
Cartman
Westsa-eed-eh.
Now in the living room with Cartman.
Chef
Take that wig off! [Does it himself.] What's gotten into you?!
Cartman
You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
Chef
What?! Noh! Uh, did I?
Cartman
He said you kissed her with your tongue.
Chef
Ooooh-ho-ho-hoh hohohohoh, that's different. Women don't get pregnant from tongue-kissing, children.
Cartman
[Dejected.] Huho. So you're not my dad?
Chef
Of course not. Here. You children sit down,
Chef props him up on a stool.
Chef
...and let me explain somethin' to you about where babies come from. THEN, you'll see why I can't be your dad.
When a man loves a woman, and a woman loves a man,
Actually, sometimes a man doesn't love a woman, buut...he acts like he does, in order to get some action, heheh
The magic starts to happen,
and the two take off their clothes,
that's right,
And they caress and touch each other,
until the part of the man grows,
Oooooooooo And they roll around and now things a-really startuh getting hot,
And the man says "I love you" and the woman says "hold on a second, I gotta go to the bathroom"
So you wait, and you wait, and you wait and you wait...
[Pause.]
...and you wait, and you wait, and you waaaaiit
And you wait and you're coolin' down and she's still goin' to the bathroom
Finally she comes back, and she says,
"Baby, I'm gettin' hot!"
And that's when you gotta jam her butt and pump her full of...

Cartman
What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
Chef
Oh, children, that was a long time ago. But I'll tell you what I remember.
Back at the Drunken Barn Dance. Chef is kissing Liane on the hay stack.
Liane
Whoa, Chef! [He pulls away a bit.] You're so strong!
Jimbo
Hey, everybody, look who's here! The AFC Champion Denver Broncos!
The barn door opens and the Broncos pour in. Most of them are "hutt-hutting".
Bronco 1
Are we late for the party?
Bronco 2
What the hell town is this?
Singing
There you are, like a throbbing star. I want-

Liane
Oooohh, Chef! Woooo, Chef!
Chef
Damn, woman, what's gotten into you?!
Liane
Woooh! Whooppee!! [She throws her arms out in ecstasy.] Unhh!
A hand appears from under the hay. Chef grabs it and pulls the rest of the body up.
Chef
Garrison! What the hell are you doing?!
Mr. Garrison
You're drunk, Mr. Hat!
Mr. Garrison is rather pleased that he did quite a bit without getting caught. Liane now looks at Mr. Garrison.
Singing
There you are-

Chef
Ooooh, man! I'm outta here!
Liane
Come on, Chef! Haven't you ever heard of a menage o'three?
Chef
Yeah! When two women are involved. [Moves away.]
Mr. Garrison
Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman.
He moves quickly on top of her and starts kissing her.
Chef
And that's... who she was with last! Mr. Garrison!
Cartman
No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
Stan's house that afternoon. He, Kyle, and Grandpa are once again looking at TV
Announcer
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-
Bob Saget
Here's a video sent to us that shows a very disturbed little boy.
Cartman
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
The audience is watching.
Polly
I think you are one of the coolest people in the world, Eric. And you are not fat at all.
The audience starts to laugh.
Cartman
Really? You don't think so?
Clyde
Naw, you're not fat.
Cartman
[Grabs a teacup.] Gee, that's kewl.
The audience is laughing harder. Stan and Kyle are laughing with the audience, and Stan's parents appear.
Sharon
Aww, Stanley. We just heard the news that your little friend Kenny was killed by a train this morning.
Stan
Huh? [Looks up at them.] Oh yeah.
Randy
Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
Stan
How 'bout some ice cream?
Kyle
Yeah, with butterscotch.
Stan nods in agreement.
Sharon
You bet, you poor dears.
Bob Saget
Now, the moment you've all been waiting for, when one of our lucky videos qualifies for the $10,000 Grand Prize to be chosen tomorrow night! The winner is [Drumroll crescendo.] Little Boy's Tea Party.
Kyle
Woohoo!
Stan
Oh, yeah! We're gonna be in the finals!
Kyle
We're gonna win $10,000! [Grandpa doesn't look pleased...]
Stan
Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! [Kyle dances gleefully.]
The Bar. Mr. McCormick and Mr. Garrison are at the bar.
Mr. Garrison
Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
Mr. Hat
Oh, just one more Cosmopolitan, Mr. Garrison.
Mr. Garrison
Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem! [To the barkeep.] Another Cosmo, please.
Cartman barges in throwing the bar doors open.
Cartman
All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
Mr. Garrison
What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
Cartman
It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
Mr. Garrison
[Gasps.] Oh.
Jimbo
Garrison? That's impossible. He's gay.
Mr. Garrison
I am not gay!
Cartman
Then you did sleep with my mom?
Mr. Garrison
No!
Jimbo
He's gay!!
Mr. Garrison
Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!
Everything stops and gasps are heard.
Mr. Garrison
Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?
Two men at a table look around and get shocked. Principal Victoria and Mayor McDaniels are seen next.
Principal Victoria
Oooooh.
Mayor McDaniels
[At the same time] Hmmm.
Jesus and Father Maxi look shocked as well. No one moves.
Grizzled Man
I haven't.
Mr. Garrison
...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!
Halfy
Oh. Yeah.
Mr. Garrison
So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know.
Cartman slumps and Jimbo takes pity on him.
Jimbo
[Approaching him.] Don't feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin' and fishin' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean.
A dirge plays as Cartman heads out of the bar. Jimbo and Mr. Garrison look on, as do Jesus and Father Maxi.
Mephesto
Wait, wait. [Cartman stops.] I know a way to find out.
He is at the bar with his little friend, Kevin.
Cartman
[Turns around.] How?
Mephesto
At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I'll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.
Cartman
Really? You can? [The dirge turns hopeful.]
Mephesto
Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...
Cartman
How much?
Mephesto
Three thousand should cover it.
Cartman
I don't have $3000.
Mephesto
Oh. Never mind.
The bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle are waiting.
Stan
Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
Kyle
I'm gonna buy a Walkman with my half.
Cartman
[Depressed.] Hi guys.
Stan
How's it going, Cartman?
Cartman
Oh, fine. How are you guys?
Kyle looks at Stan, both are worried.
Kyle
Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
Cartman
Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
Stan
Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
Cartman
Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don't have $3000.
Stan
Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
Cartman
Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...
Stan and Kyle look at each other again, seeing who'll make a move first.
Cartman
Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
Kyle
Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
Cartman
[Suddenly bright.] You do?
Stan
Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
Cartman
You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
Stan
Uh, yyeah.
Cartman's house that night. The boys are on the sofa.
Announcer
And now, back to America's Stupidest Home Videos-
Cartman
What kind of video did you guys make?
Stan
Uuh, you'll see.
Bob Saget
Well, it's time to crown the $10,000 winner. Our judges have narrowed it down to only three videos-first it's... "Dog Who Puts Hat On Master's Head."
Falsetto Bob Saget
Oh, I'm a little dog. I'm just a little dog. [The dog picks up a hat and walks towards a man on a chair.] Hahaha. [Leaps up behind the man and drops the hat in place.] Hold on, I've got to put a hat on my master's head, [Jumps off, and the man turns to see the camera.] hehehahahuh.
The audience laughs. One woman with red curly hair is particularly tickled by the video.
Bob Saget
And now our second finalist, "Little Boy Has A Tea Party."
Cartman reacts to what he sees on screen, which is a video of his tea party two days before.
Cartman
Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
Polly
Oh, thank you, Eric.
The audience starts to laugh. Cartman is shocked, and Kyle, seeing Cartman's reaction, is afraid.
Bob Saget
Boy! Looks like this kid needs some therapy! Heheheheheh, heheheh.
Stan
We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!
Cartman's anger is beginning to build.
Cartman
I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
Kyle
[Trying some encouragement] They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!
Stan smiles, Kyle throws his arms up.
Kyle
We're gonna win!.
Bob Saget
And finally our third contestant, "Young Child Gets Hit By A Train."
Falsetto Bob Saget
Oh, I'm such a cute little kid.
It is the scene where Kenny gets killed. Stan and Kyle are shocked, Cartman is angrier.
Falsetto Bob Saget
Hmmm, I wonder if I can get this go-cart started.]
The go-cart starts and pulls Kenny along 'round a corner, back again, into some tree, and finally onto the railroad tracks.
Falsetto Bob Saget
Oh! I hope I don't get hit by a train.
The train demolishes him.
Falsetto Bob Saget
Ooooh, I sure did.
Stan and Kyle are agape, and the audience roars with laughter.
Stan
Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
Kyle
You bastards!
Bob Saget
Now, that's what I call a joyride. Heeheeheeh.
The audience continues laughing.
Bob Saget
And the winner is, naturally, "Little Boy Being Hit By A Train,"
Stan is stunned, Kyle is cross.
Bob Saget
Nnnnhnnnhnnnh.
The audience laughs harder.
Stan
Dude. We lost.
Kyle
Dammit!
Cartman
[Slowly, deliberately.] I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously.
Getting more livid with every word.
Bob Saget
Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh.
Grandpa
I won! I won!
Stan's eyes grow large.
Stan
Grandpa!!
Bob Saget
Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time.
He chuckles as the show ends.
Kyle
Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
Cartman is very livid now.
Cartman
Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Thunder and lightning abound.
Mephesto
All right. From everyone's accounts, I've narrowed down Eric's possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef [Blinks up.], Jimbo [A bit shocked.], Mr. Garrison [Eyebrows up.], Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski [Surprised.], myself, my friend Kevin [Looks up at him.], or, the 1989 Denver Broncos.
Stan
Wow. I always knew Cartman's mom was a slut, but Goddamn!
Mephesto
The test results are in this envelope.
Cartman is hopeful.
Mephesto
Shall I... open it?
Mr. Garrison
[Impatiently.] Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!
Mephesto
Erhum ehrum uh [Gasps.] The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-
Announcer
[An organ plays.] Who is Eric Cartman's father? Is it - Chief Running Water? [Looks askance.] Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? [Looks around.] Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?
Jimbo
Nope. He's gay.
Mr. Garrison
You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
Announcer
Is it Jimbo?
Jimbo
[Aghast.] Daaagh!
Announcer
Or is Officer Barbrady?
Officer Barbrady
Huh?! Where?!
Announcer
Or could it be Ned?
Ned
Could be.
Announcer
Or Mr. Broflovski??
Kyle
[Pissed.] Dad, how could you?!
Announcer
Or is it the 1991 Denver Broncos? The answer is coming on an all-new South Park, in just four weeks.
Cartman
[Record scratches.] What?! [Enunciating] Son of a bitch!
